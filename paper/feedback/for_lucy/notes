Equations (pages)

1. crop production function with irrigation, land, crop-specific advantages
2. irrigation production with capital and water consumption
3. profit function with crop price, production function, water market prices
4. surface water extraction limit contraint
5. ground water extraction limit contraint
6. definition of A -- vector of crop producties
7. Cramer's rule => 




Questions:
- equ. 3 -- is there really a unique crop chioce only given convavity in production and continuous A? What if each production function with neighboring A_c (parameterized by a_c) have discontinuously different a_c? There are probably some conditions under which there is a unique optimal crop choice, but I think more would be necessary.
