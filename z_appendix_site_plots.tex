\caption{Comparison of PM2.5 concentration densities for two sets of hours: reported (blue) and missing (red) hourly observations of the NAAQS monitor. Both densities use the hourly PurpleAir PM2.5 concentration estimates for this site, calculated using the IDW average of PurpleAir sensors within 5 miles of the NAAQS monitor location. This monitor is at site 0007 in county 059 (FIPS code).}
