	abstract = {The knockoff-based multiple testing setup of Barber \& Candes (2015) for variable selection in multiple regression where sample size is as large as the number of explanatory variables is considered. The method of Benjamini \& Hochberg (1995) based on ordinary least squares estimates of the regression coefficients is adjusted to the setup, transforming it to a valid p-value based false discovery rate controlling method not relying on any specific correlation structure of the explanatory variables. Simulations and real data applications show that our proposed method that is agnostic to \{{\textbackslash}pi\}0, the proportion of unimportant explanatory variables, and a data-adaptive version of it that uses an estimate of \{{\textbackslash}pi\}0 are powerful competitors of the false discovery rate controlling method in Barber \& Candes (2015).},

	abstract = {The linear step-up multiple testing procedure controls the false discovery rate at the desired level q for independent and positively dependent test statistics. When all null hypotheses are true, and the test statistics are independent and continuous, the bound is sharp. When some of the null hypotheses are not true, the procedure is conservative by a factor which is the proportion m₀/m of the true null hypotheses among the hypotheses. We provide a new two-stage procedure in which the linear step-up procedure is used in stage one to estimate m₀, providing a new level q′ which is used in the linear step-up procedure in the second stage. We prove that a general form of the two-stage procedure controls the false discovery rate at the desired level q. This framework enables us to study analytically the properties of other procedures that exist in the literature. A simulation study is presented that shows that two-stage adaptive procedures improve in power over the original procedure, mainly because they provide tighter control of the false discovery rate. We further study the performance of the current suggestions, some variations of the procedures, and previous suggestions, in the case where the test statistics are positively dependent, a case for which the original procedure controls the false discovery rate. In the setting studied here the newly proposed two-stage procedure is the only one that controls the false discovery rate. The procedures are illustrated with two examples of biological importance.},

	abstract = {The view that the returns to educational investments are highest for early childhood interventions is widely held and stems primarily from several influential randomized trials—Abecedarian, Perry, and the Early Training Project—that point to super-normal returns to early interventions. This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys. These conclusions, which have appeared ambiguous when using “naive” estimators that fail to adjust for multiple testing, contribute to a growing literature on the emerging female–male academic achievement gap. They also demonstrate that in complex studies where multiple questions are asked of the same data set, it can be important to declare the family of tests under consideration and to either consolidate measures or report adjusted and unadjusted p values.},

	abstract = {Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts 
involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being

for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in 
this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A 
broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and

A large and growing literature examines whether these costs are disproportionately borne by different sectors of the economy and/or across different groups of individuals. However, much less is known about how the environmental benefits created by these policies are distributed, which mirror the differences in environmental damages associated with existing environmental externalities. We review this burgeoning literature and develop a simple general framework for empirical analysis. We apply this framework to findings concerning the distributional impacts of environmental damages from air pollution, deforestation, and climate change and highlight priorities for future research. A recurring challenge to understanding the distributional effects of environmental damages is distinguishing between cases in which populations are exposed to different levels or changes in an environmental good and those in which an incremental change in the environment may have very different implications for some populations. In the latter case, it is often difficult to empirically identify the underlying sources of heterogeneity in marginal damages because damages may stem from nonlinear and/or heterogeneous damage functions. Nevertheless, understanding the determinants of heterogeneity in environmental benefits and damages is crucial for welfare analysis and policy design.},

Employing per ton damage estimates for the co-pollutants produced by an integrated assessment model, co-pollutant damage estimates per ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) are developed for over 10,000 sources of GHGs in the lower 48 states including both transportation sources and electric power generation. For coal-fired electric power generation, the co-pollutant damages are larger in magnitude than recent peer-reviewed estimates of the marginal damage for GHGs. The co-pollutant damage per ton CO2e varies considerably across source types and source location. The paper estimates the welfare gain from adopting a policy that encompasses the spatially variant co-pollutant damage to be between \$1 million and \$85 million annually. The range depends on the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. The paper also shows that a distortionary aggregate emission cap reduces the advantage of differentiated policy. Provided an excessively strict cap, the spatially differentiated policy may reduce aggregate welfare. This result has important implications for GHG policy in the United States; although co-pollutant benefits of abating GHGs have been shown to be significant in magnitude, tailoring climate policy to reflect these source-specific co-benefits is not necessarily socially beneficial. This bolsters arguments for upstream policy designs.},

	abstract = {Advocates of using market mechanisms for addressing greenhouse gases and other pollutants typically argue that it is a necessary step in pricing polluting goods at their social marginal cost (SMC). Retail electricity prices, however, deviate from social marginal cost for many reasons. Some cause prices to be too low—such as un-priced pollution externalities—while others cause prices to be too high—such as recovery of fixed costs. Furthermore, because electricity is not storable, marginal cost can fluctuate widely within even a day, while nearly all residential retail prices are static over weeks or months. We study the relationship between residential electricity prices and social marginal cost in the US, both on average and over time. We find that the difference between the standard residential electricity rate and the utility's average (over hours) social marginal cost exhibits large regional variation, with price well above average SMC in some areas and price well below average SMC in other areas. Furthermore, we find that for most utilities the largest source of difference between price and SMC is the failure of price to reflect variation in SMC over time. In a standard demand framework, total deadweight loss over a time period is proportional to the sum of squared differences between a constant price and SMC, which can be decomposed into the component due to price deviating from average SMC and the component due to the variation in SMC. Our estimates imply if demand elasticity were the same in response to hourly price variation as to changes in average price, then for most utilities the majority of deadweight loss would be attributable to the failure to adopt time-varying pricing. Nonetheless, in a few areas—led by California—price greatly exceeds average SMC causing the largest deadweight losses.},

	abstract = {Traditional command-and-control approaches to air pollution regulation
typically require companies to use specified pollution control technologies
or require classes of emissions sources to meet performance standards. Such
approaches ration each source's use of t he air as a receiver for pollutants
in order to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) or other air
quality goals.
These approaches provide little flexibility to companies in determining
the degree to or the way in which pollution control requirements are met. They
provide no economic incentive to companies to install controls quickly or to
go beyond regulatory requirements. They provide little incentive to innovation
which could decrease long term pollution control costs or make more effective
control possible. These characteristics probably result in a regulatory program
that costs more and in the long run may do less to protect the environment than
might otherwise be possible.
Economic incentives can overcome some of the limitations of t r aditional
regulatory approaches by providing the flexibility that is missing with commandand-control approaches and giving sources incentives to use that flexibility.
Because polluters have greater knowledge about their own control costs, plans
for development and possibilities for technological advance than government
officials, they can use this knowledge to respond to pollution control requirements in a cost-effective way.
This report responds to the requirement in Section 40S(g) of the Clean
Air Act (CAA), as Amended, for a general report to Congress on economic incentive approaches to air pollution control. Section 405 of the CAA directs EPA
and the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) to identify, study and assess economic measures which could:
o 	 strengthen the effectiveness of existing regulatory requirements by
encouraging compliance;
o 	 provide incentives to abate pollution to a greater degree than is
required by existing regulations; and 
S-2 

o 	 serve as a primary means to control air pollu,tion problems that are
not addressed by existing regulations.
A report to Congress analyzing the use of economic incentives to control stationary source NOx emissions was completed in early 1981 in accord with Section 405(f) of the Clean Air Act Amendments.
This Executive Summary discusses the implications of any desirable changes
to existing legislation, and then presents the major analytic conclusions
reached by EPA and CEA.},

We empirically test our theoretical predictions by leveraging a natural experiment – the unexpected disclosure of PM2.5 data in China. We find that perception bias before the data disclosure leads to a downward estimation bias in hedonic valuation. The hedonic price of avoiding PM2.5 exposure increases substantially from 171 to 336 Chinese Yuan in response to the information shock. Our work sheds light on the application of Rosen-Roback theory for non-market valuation in countries where the public access to information is restricted.},

	abstract = {Households "sort" across neighborhoods according to their wealth and their
preferences for public goods, social characteristics, and commuting opportunities. The
aggregation of these individual choices in markets and in other institutions influences
the supply of amenities and local public goods. Pollution, congestion, and the quality
of public education are examples. Over the past decade, advances in economic models
of this sorting process have led to a new framework that promises to alter the ways we
conceptualize the policy evaluation process in the future. These "equilibrium sorting"
models use the properties of market equilibria, together with information on household
behavior, to infer structural parameters that characterize preference heterogeneity.
The results can be used to develop theoretically consistent predictions for the welfare
implications of future policy changes. Analysis is not confined to marginal effects
or a partial equilibrium setting. Nor is it limited to prices and quantities. Sorting
models can integrate descriptions of how nonmarket goods are generated, estimate
how they affect decision making, and, in turn, predict how they will be affected by
future policies targeting prices or quantities. Conversely, sorting models can predict
how equilibrium prices and quantities will be affected by policies that target product
quality, information, or amenities generated by the sorting process. These capabilities
are just beginning to be understood and used in applied research. This survey article
aims to synthesize the state of knowledge on equilibrium sorting, the new possibilities
for policy analysis, and the conceptual and empirical challenges that define the
frontiers of the literature.},

This method is routinely used in environmental economics to derive the economic valuation of environmental attributes such as air pollution and water quality. For example, the “Ricardian approach” is based on a hedonic regression of land values on historical climate variables. Forecasts of future climate can then be employed to estimate the future costs of climate change. We show that this approach is only valid if current land markets ignore climate forecasts. While this assumption was defensible decades ago (when this literature first emerged), it is reasonable to hypothesize that information on climate change is so pervasive today that markets may already price in expectations of future climate change. Indeed, we show empirically that agricultural land markets in the United States now capitalize expectations about future climate change. We derive a straightforward empirical correction to the standard Ricardian approach (called the “Forward-Looking Ricardian Approach”) that can be implemented with readily available data. Accounting for market beliefs decreases the estimated magnitude of climate change damages by 50\%–62\%.},

This study combines a large-scale field experiment with a residential sorting model to derive utility-theoretic measures of renter welfare loss associated with the constraints imposed by discrimination in the rental housing market. Results from experiments conducted in five cities show that key neighborhood amenities are associated with higher levels of discrimination. Results from the structural model indicate that discrimination imposes costs equivalent to 4.7\% of annual income for renters of color, and that search behavior results in greater welfare costs for African Americans as their incomes rise. Renters of color must make substantial investments in additional search to mitigate the costs of these constraints. We find that a naïve model ignoring discrimination constraints yields significantly biased estimates of willingness to pay.},

We compare housing market outcomes in the areas surrounding the first 400 hazardous waste sites chosen for Superfund cleanups to the areas surrounding the 290 sites that narrowly missed qualifying for these cleanups. We find that Superfund cleanups are associated with economically small and statistically insignificant changes in residential property values, property rental rates, housing supply, total population, and types of individuals living near the sites. These findings are robust to a series of specification checks, including the application of a regression discontinuity design based on knowledge of the selection rule. Overall, the preferred estimates suggest that the local benefits of Superfund cleanups are small and appear to be substantially lower than the \$43 million mean cost of Superfund cleanups.},

We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extreme cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates, especially for the elderly. Critically, this relationship is flattened by both higher incomes and adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2\% of global GDP in 2100 under a high emissions scenario. Notably, today’s cold locations are projected to benefit, while today’s poor and hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of \$36.6 under a high emissions scenario and using a 2\% discount rate, with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of [-\$7.8, \$73.0]. Under a moderate emissions scenario, these damages are valued at \$17.1 [-\$24.7, \$53.6]. These empirically grounded estimates exceed the previous literature’s estimates by an order of magnitude.},

                Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question.
              
            
            
              Methods
              We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or “natural experiments”; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions.
            
            
              Results
              
                Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate’s influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant (
                P
                {\textless} 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4\% and intergroup conflict by 14\% (median estimates).
              
            
            
              Discussion
              We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades—with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050—amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries.

            Climate and Conflict

              (p.

              , published online 1 August) provide a meta-analysis of data from disciplines as disparate as archaeology and psychology to examine the relation between climate and conflict. Overall, warmer temperatures or extremes of rainfall can be causally associated with changes in interpersonal violence and in civil war.
            
          , 
            Across disciplinary boundaries, recently published evidence links climate change to increased violent conflict.
          , 
            A rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4\% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14\%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2σ to 4σ by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.},

Second, the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day–related fatalities.

	abstract = {This chapter contains a detailed treatment of the human capital model of the demand for health which was originally developed in 1972. Theoretical predictions are discussed, and theoretical extensions of the model are reviewed. Empirical research that tests the predictions of the model or studies causality between years of formal schooling completed and good health is surveyed. The model views health as a durable capital stock that yields an output of healthy time. Individuals inherit an initial amount of this stock that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. The household production function model of consumer behavior is employed to account for the gap between health as an output and medical care as one of many inputs into its production. In this framework the “shadow price” of health depends on many variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education (years of formal schooling completed) if more educated people are more efﬁcient producers of health. An important result is that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantities of health inputs demanded.},

We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30-46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63-82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
              For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research has begun to illuminate key linkages in the coupling of these complex natural and human systems, uncovering notable effects of climate on health, agriculture, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Past scholars of climate-society interactions were limited to theorizing on the basis of anecdotal evidence; advances in computing, data availability, and study design now allow researchers to draw generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events to social outcomes. This endeavor has demonstrated that a range of climate factors have substantial influence on societies and economies, both past and present, with important implications for the future.
              
                Temperature, in particular, exerts remarkable influence over human systems at many social scales; heat induces mortality, has lasting impact on fetuses and infants, and incites aggression and violence while lowering human productivity. High temperatures also damage crops, inflate electricity demand, and may trigger population movements within and across national borders. Tropical cyclones cause mortality, damage assets, and reduce economic output for long periods. Precipitation extremes harm economies and populations predominately in agriculturally dependent settings.  These effects are often quantitatively substantial; for example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields roughly 48\%, warming trends since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by 11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by 0.28 percentage points year
                −1
                .
              
              
                Much research aims to forecast impacts of future climate change, but we point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected end-of-century impacts of climate change. For instance, we calculate that current temperature climatologies slow global economic growth roughly 0.25 percentage points year
                −1
                , comparable to the additional slowing of 0.28 percentage points year
                −1
                projected from future warming.
              
              Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climate—why this has not already occurred everywhere remains a critical open question.  For example, clear patterns of adaptation in health impacts and in response to tropical cyclones contrast strongly with limited adaptation in agricultural and macroeconomic responses to temperature. Although some theories suggest these various levels of adaptation ought to be economically optimal, in the sense that costs of additional adaptive actions should exactly balance the benefits of avoided climate-related losses, there is no evidence that allows us to determine how closely observed “adaptation gaps” reflect optimal investments or constrained suboptimal adaptation that should be addressed through policy.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              Recent findings provide insight into the historical evolution of the global economy; they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we understand the consequences of future climate changes.  Although climate is clearly not the only factor that affects social and economic outcomes, new quantitative measurements reveal that it is a major factor, often with first-order consequences. Research over the coming decade will seek to understand the numerous mechanisms that drive these effects, with the hope that policy may interfere with the most damaging pathways of influence.
              Both current and future generations will benefit from near-term investigations.  “Cracking the code” on when, where, and why adaptation is or is not successful will generate major social benefits today and in the future.  In addition, calculations used to design global climate change policies require as input “damage functions” that describe how social and economic losses accrue under different climatic conditions, essential elements that now can (and should) be calibrated to real-world relationships. Designing effective, efficient, and fair policies to manage anthropogenic climate change requires that we possess a quantitative grasp of how different investments today may affect economic and social possibilities in the future.
              
                
                  Two globes depict two possible futures for how the climate might change and how those changes are likely to affect humanity, based on recent empirical findings.
                  Base colors are temperature change under “Business as usual” (left, RCP 8.5) and “stringent emissions mitigation” (right, RCP 2.6). Overlaid are composite satellite images of nighttime lights with rescaled intensity reflecting changes in economic productivity in each climate scenario.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by {\textasciitilde}48\%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by {\textasciitilde}11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by {\textasciitilde}0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.},

            There is strong evidence that short-run fluctuations in air pollution negatively impact infant health and contemporaneous adult health, but there is less evidence on the causal link between long-term exposure to air pollution and increased adult mortality. This project estimates the impact of long-term exposure to air pollution on mortality by leveraging quasi-random variation in pollution levels generated by wind patterns near major highways. I combine geocoded data on the residence of every decedent in Los Angeles over three years, high-frequency wind data, and Census short form data. Using these data, I estimate the effect of downwind exposure to highway-generated pollutants on the age-specific mortality rate by using orientation to the nearest major highway as an instrument for pollution exposure. I find that doubling the percentage of time spent downwind of a highway increases mortality among individuals 75 or older by 3.8\%–6.5\%. These estimates are robust and imply significant loss of life years.},

These airports are some of the largest sources of air pollution in the US, and they experience large changes in daily air pollution emissions depending on the amount of time planes spend idling on the tarmac. Excess airplane idling, measured as residual daily taxi time, is due to network delays originating in the Eastern US. This idiosyncratic variation in daily airplane taxi time significantly impacts the health of local residents, largely driven by increased levels of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. We use this variation in daily airport congestion to estimate the population doseresponse of health outcomes to daily CO exposure, examining hospitalization rates for asthma, respiratory, and heart-related emergency room admissions. A one standard deviation increase in daily pollution levels leads to an additional \$ 540 thousand in hospitalization costs for respiratory and heart-related admissions for the 6 million individuals living within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the airports in California. These health effects occur at levels of CO exposure far below existing Environmental Protection Agency mandates, and our results suggest there may be sizable morbidity benefits from lowering the existing CO standard.},

	abstract = {This paper's findings suggest that an arbitrary Chinese policy that greatly increases total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based on China's Huai River policy, which provided free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 µg/m³ [95\% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55\% higher in the north. Further, the results indicate that life expectancies are about 5.5 y (95\% CI: 0.8, 10.2) lower in the north owing to an increased incidence of cardiorespiratory mortality. More generally, the analysis suggests that long-term exposure to an additional 100 µg/m³ of TSPs is associated with a reduction in life expectancy at birth of about 3.0 y (95\% CI: 0.4, 5.6).},

We find that a 1-percent reduction in TSPs results in a 0.35 percent decline in the infant mortality rate at the county level, implying that 2500 fewer infants died from 1980-1982 than would have in the absence of the TSPs reductions. Most of these effects are driven by fewer deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure is a potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals nonlinear effects of TSPs pollution and greater sensitivity of black infant mortality at the county level. Importantly, the estimates are stable across a variety of specifications.},

This project links administrative Census microdata to newly available, spatially continuous high resolution measures of ambient particulate pollution (PM2.5) to examine the underlying causes and consequences of differences in Black-White pollution exposures. We begin by decomposing differences in pollution exposure into components explained by observable population characteristics (e.g., income) versus those that remain unexplained. We then use quantile regression methods to show that a significant portion of the “unexplained” convergence in Black-White pollution exposure can be attributed to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in African American and non-Hispanic White communities. Areas with larger Black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5 exposure. We show that the CAA has been the single largest contributor to racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the U.S. since 2000 accounting for over 60 percent of the reduction.},

First, subsidies shift out demand and increase equilibrium quantities, holding production costs ﬁxed. Second, subsidies may encourage ﬁrms to innovate to reduce their costs over time. I quantify these impacts by estimating a dynamic structural model of competition among solar panel manufacturers. The model produces two key insights. First, ignoring long-run supply responses can generate biased estimates of the effects of government policy. Without accounting for induced innovation, subsidies increased global solar adoption 49 percent over the period 2010-2015, leading to over \$15 billion in external social beneﬁts. Accounting for induced innovation increases the external beneﬁts by at least 22 percent. Second, decentralized government intervention in a global market is inefﬁcient. A subsidy in one country increases long-run solar adoption elsewhere because it increases investment in innovation by international ﬁrms. This spillover underscores the need for international coordination to address climate change.},

In equilibrium the market is efficient and is not fooled: it correctly conjectures that there will be earnings inflation, and adjusts for this in making inferences. Nonetheless, managers, who take the market's conjectures as fixed, continue to behave myopically. The model is useful in assessing evidence that has been presented in che “myopia” debate. It also yields some novel implications regarding firm structure and the limits of intergation.},

We find that many unusual aspects of the aircraft data, such as high concentration and persistent pricing below static marginal cost, are explained by this model. We also find that the unconstrained MPE is quite efficient from a social perspective, providing only 10\% less welfare on average than a social planner would obtain.

Although temperatures continue to rise at an alarming rate, some observers argue that increasing global investment in clean energy signals progress. But gushing investment flows to deploy existing clean energy technologies obscure a discouraging countercurrent: investment in new, innovative technologies has slowed to a trickle. Advanced technologies -- including energy-dense batteries, safer nuclear reactors, and dirt-cheap solar materials -- will be essential to a low-carbon transition that avoids slowing the world economy while proceeding at the scale and speed required to confront climate change. But the widening investment gap between deployment and innovation endangers prospects for improving the performance and reducing the cost of clean energy. The result is technological lock-in, a syndrome endemic to markets in which the next technology generation cannot replace the existing one. Nuclear power provides a clear example of such lock-in. But two other platforms -- wind power and efficient lighting -- exhibit healthy technological succession rather than lock-in.},

This paper offers a different view. Employing analytical and numerically solved general equilibrium models, it provides plausible conditions under which a more conventional form of regulation—namely, the use of a clean energy standard (CES)—is more cost-effective. The models reveal that the CES distorts factor markets less because it is a smaller implicit tax on factors of production. This advantage more than offsets the disadvantages of the CES when minor emissions reductions are involved. (JEL H23, Q42, Q48, Q54, Q58)},

This effect is explained by short-term suppression of pollution on monitored days, especially during high-pollution periods when the city’s noncompliance risk is high.

This is derived from Shepard’s method of spatial interpolation (1968). The paper discusses the arbitrary character of the exponent of distance and the problem of monitoring stations that are close to the reference point. From elementary laws of physics, it is determined which exponent of distance should be chosen (or its upper bound) depending on the form of pollution encountered, such as radiant pollution (including radioactivity and sound), air pollution (plumes, puffs, and motionless clouds by using the classical Gaussian model), and polluted rivers. The case where a station is confused with the reference point (or zero distance) is also discussed: in real cases this station imposes its measurement on the whole area regardless of the measurements made by other stations. This is a serious flaw when evaluating the mean pollution of an area. However, it is shown that this is not so in the case of a continuum of monitoring stations, and the measurement at the reference point and for the whole area may differ, which is satisfactory.},

We then turn to the potential causal mechanisms behind the observed correlations. Given its focus on causal econometric models, we argue that economics has a comparative advantage in evaluating these mechanisms. We consider (a) profit-maximizing decisions by firms, (b) Tiebout-like utility-maximizing decisions by households in the presence of income disparities, (c) Coasean negotiations between both sides, (d) political economy explanations and governmental failures, and (e) intergenerational transmission of poverty.

This article presents best practices for hedonic property-value modeling when the goal is to measure households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a change in a spatially varying amenity. The starting point is a research design that identifies a source of exogenous variation in an amenity that is observable by prospective buyers (e.g., air quality). Data on the sales prices and physical attributes of houses, together with location-specific measures for amenities, are then used to estimate a housing-price function. Under ideal conditions, the derivative of this price function can be interpreted as indicating the amenity’s implicit price, which can then be used to calculate household marginal WTP for the amenity. In principle, this process is straightforward. In practice, modeling decisions must be made to define variables that measure sale prices and amenities and to select an econometric specification. Although the number of issues to address when developing a “best practices” study may seem daunting, the effort is both worthwhile and important for developing accurate measures of the WTP for environmental quality.},

It further shows that this effect is a lower bound on general equilibrium welfare. Thus, nonmarginal welfare can be recovered using transparent designs without Rosen’s second stage or more structural models.

	abstract = {We consider identification of nonparametric random utility models of multinomial choice using "micro data," i.e., observation of the characteristics and choices of individual consumers. Our model of preferences nests random coefficients discrete choice models widely used in practice with parametric functional form and distributional assumptions. However, the model is nonparametric and distribution free. It allows choice- specific unobservables, endogenous choice characteristics, unknown heteroskedasticity, and high-dimensional correlated taste shocks. Under standard "large support" and instrumental variables assumptions, we show identifiability of the random utility model. We demonstrate robustness of these results to relaxation of the large support condition and show that when it is replaced with a weaker "common choice probability" condition, the demand structure is still identified. We show that key maintained hypotheses are testable.},

	abstract = {Oil and gas wells emit large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane emissions are rarely priced and lightly regulated—in part because they are hard to measure—leading to a large climate externality. However, measurement technology is improving, with remote sensing and other techniques opening the door for policy innovation. We present a theoretical model of emissions abatement at the well level and a range of feasible policy options, then use data constructed from cross-sectional scientific studies to estimate abatement costs. We simulate audit policies under realistic constraints, varying the information the regulator uses in choosing wells to audit. These policies become more effective when they can target on well covariates, detect leaks remotely, and charge higher fees for leaks. We estimate that a policy that audits 1\% of wells with uniform probability achieves less than 1\% of the gains of the infeasible first best. Using the same number of audits targeted on remotely sensed emissions data achieves gains of 30–60\% of the first best. These results demonstrate that, because leaks are rare events, targeting is essential for achieving welfare gains and emissions reductions. Auditing a small fraction of wells can have a large impact when properly targeted.},

	abstract = {How will self-driving trucks transform U.S. interstate trade? I argue that human drivers’ preferences to return home generate geographic specialization in the freight market, and self-driving trucks would eliminate this "home bias." I build a model of trucking carriers who make dynamic decisions about where to work, given that they prefer to be at home. A large home bias increases the value of driving places that are likely to bring one home and increases the value of taking time oﬀ at home. Using trucking freight transactions and highway inspections data, I estimate the model parameters and ﬁnd that carriers value being at home at \$70 per day or about 1/3 of the daily wage. In a counterfactual where self-driving trucks lower per-mile costs, double the daily driving range, and eliminate home bias, overall freight prices fall by 25.6 percent. Without home bias, carriers shift from driver-rich states to driver-poor states and total driving increases as carriers spend less time oﬀ. Eliminating home bias explains about 20 percent of the fall in overall prices, comparable in magnitude to the eﬀect of increased daily driving range.},

@article{vatter_quality_nodate,
	title = {Quality {Disclosure} and {Regulation}},
	abstract = {Regulators often generate quality scores to help consumers with limited information about product quality, as in schooling, healthcare, and ﬁnancial markets. When designing scores, regulators must not only anticipate how they will inﬂuence consumer choices but also the resulting impact on ﬁrms’ incentives to invest in quality. In this work, I draw on theoretical insights, econometric strategies, and computational methods to develop an empirical scoring design methodology. I apply it to a large health insurance market and ﬁnd an alternative policy which vastly improves the market’s performance. The new design coarsens consumers’ information about lower-quality insurance options but reﬁnes it for higher-quality ones. Changes to available product information generate a shift in demand towards higher-quality plans, triggering additional ﬁrm investments and making consumers better informed about a menu of superior options. The new design also optimally aggregates diﬀerent quality dimensions, tackling a multitasking moral hazard problem. The friction is due to ﬁrms’ (agent) private incentives to attain scores using cost-eﬃcient investments instead of consumer-valued ones, preferred by the regulator (principal). Overall, the alternative policy increases welfare by \$669 per enrollee per year. The analysis reveals that simple scores can be remarkably eﬀective if well-designed and provides a method to construct them.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the problem of ﬁrms that operate platforms matching buyers and sellers, while also selling goods on these same platforms. By being able to guide consumer search through algorithmic recommendations, these ﬁrms can inﬂuence market outcomes, a ﬁnding that has worried regulators. To analyze this phenomenon, we combine rich novel data about sales and recommendations on Amazon Marketplace with a structural model of intermediation power. In contrast to prior literature, we explicitly model seller entry. This feature enables us to assess the most plausible theory of harm from self-preferencing, i.e. that it is a barrier to entry. We ﬁnd that recommendations are highly price elastic but favor Amazon. A substantial fraction of customers only consider recommended offers, and recommendations hence noticeably raise the price elasticity of demand. By preferring Amazon’s offer, the recommendation algorithm raises consumer welfare by approximately \$4.5 billion (since consumers also prefer these offers). However, consumers are made worse off if self-preferencing makes the company raise prices by more than 7.8\%. By contrast, we ﬁnd no evidence of consumer harm from self-preferencing through the entry channel. Nevertheless, entry matters. The algorithm raises consumer welfare in the short and medium run by increasing the purchase rate and intensifying price competition. However, these gains are mostly offset by reduced entry in the long run.},

	abstract = {This paper empirically studies the distributional consequences of aﬃrmative action in the context of a centralized college admission system. We examine the eﬀects of a large-scale program in Brazil that mandated all federal public institutions to reserve half their seats for public high school students, prioritizing those from socioeconomically and racially marginalized groups. After the policy was put in place, the representation of public high school students of color in the most selective federal degrees increased by 73\%. We exploit degree admission cutoﬀs to estimate the eﬀects of increasing aﬃrmative action by one reserved seat on the quality of the degree attended four years later. Our estimates indicate that the gains for beneﬁted students are 1.6 times the costs experienced by displaced students. To study the eﬀects of larger changes in aﬃrmative action, we estimate a joint model of school choice and potential outcomes. We identify the parameters of the model using exogenous variation in test scores—arising from random assignment to graders of varying strictness—that changes the availability of degrees for otherwise identical individuals. We ﬁnd that the policy creates impacts on college attendance and persistence that imply overall income gains of 1.16\% for the average targeted student, and losses of 0.93\% for the average non-targeted student. Overall, the policy prompted a negligible increase in predicted income of 0.1\% across all students in the population. Taken together, we ﬁnd that the aﬃrmative action policy had important distributional consequences, which resulted in almost one-to-one transfers from the non-targeted to the targeted group. These results indicate that introducing aﬃrmative action can increase equity without aﬀecting the overall eﬃciency of the education system.},

Leveraging the discontinuity at the nonattainment threshold, we ﬁnd evidence of avoidance by local regulators in attainment counties. Our results suggest that monitoring data in attainment counties systematically understates ambient pollution compared to nonattainment counties.},

We develop geoscience-derived estimates of PM2.5 composition from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, and statistically fuse these estimates with ground-based observations using a geographically weighted regression over North America to produce a spatially complete representation of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic matter, mineral dust, and sea-salt over 2000–2016. Significant long-term agreement is found with cross-validation sites over North America (R2 = 0.57—0.96), with the strongest agreement for sulfate (R2 = 0.96), nitrate (R2 = 0.90), and ammonium (R2 = 0.86). We find that North American decreases in population-weighted fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations since 2000 have been most heavily influenced by regional changes in sulfate and organic matter. Regionally, the relative importance of several chemical components are found to change with PM2.5 concentration, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations having a larger proportion of nitrate and a smaller proportion of sulfate. This data set offers information for research into the health effects of PM2.5 chemical components.},

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning algorithms have very high predictive ability. However, no study has used machine learning to estimate historical concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) at daily time scale in China at a national level.
Objectives: To estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China during 2005–2016.
Methods: Daily ground-level PM2.5 data were obtained from 1479 stations across China during 2014–2016. Data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological conditions and other predictors were downloaded. A random forests model (non-parametric machine learning algorithms) and two traditional regression models were developed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The best-ﬁt model was then utilized to estimate the daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China with a resolution of 0.1° (≈10 km) during 2005–2016.
Results: The daily random forests model showed much higher predictive accuracy than the other two traditional regression models, explaining the majority of spatial variability in daily PM2.5 [10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 = 83\%, root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) = 28.1 μg/m3]. At the monthly and annual time-scale, the explained variability of average PM2.5 increased up to 86\% (RMSE = 10.7 μg/m3 and 6.9 μg/m3, respectively).
Conclusions: Taking advantage of a novel application of modeling framework and the most recent ground-level PM2.5 observations, the machine learning method showed higher predictive ability than previous studies.},

A global chemical transport model (GEOS-CHEM) is used to simulate the factors affecting the relation between AOD and PM2.5. AERONET AOD is used to evaluate the method (r = 0.71, N = 48, slope = 0.69). We find significant spatial variation of the annual mean ground-based measurements with PM2.5 determined from MODIS (r = 0.69, N = 199, slope = 0.82) and MISR (r = 0.58, N = 199, slope = 0.57). Excluding California significantly increases the respective slopes and correlations. The relative vertical profile of aerosol extinction is the most important factor affecting the spatial relationship between satellite and surface measurements of PM2.5; neglecting this parameter would reduce the spatial correlation to 0.36. In contrast, temporal variation in AOD is the most influential parameter affecting the temporal relationship between satellite and surface measurements of PM2.5; neglecting daily variation in this parameter would decrease the correlation in eastern North America from 0.5–0.8 to less than 0.2. Other simulated aerosol properties, such as effective radius and extinction efficiency have a minor role temporally, but do influence the spatial correlation. Global mapping of PM2.5 from both MODIS and MISR reveals annual mean concentrations of 40–50 ug/m3 over northern India and China.},

Currently, no operational retrieval simulates these a priori proﬁles at both high spatial and high temporal resolution. Here we examine the additional beneﬁts of daily variations in a priori proﬁles for retrievals already simulating a priori NO2 proﬁles at sufﬁciently high spatial resolution to identify variations of NO2 within urban plumes. We show the effects of introducing daily variation into a priori proﬁles can be as large as 40 \% and 3×1015 molec. cm−2 for an individual day and lead to corrections as large as −13 \% for a monthly average in a case study of Atlanta, GA, USA. Additionally, we show that NOx emissions estimated from space-based remote sensing using daily, high-spatial-resolution a priori proﬁles are ∼ 100 \% greater than those of a retrieval using spatially coarse a priori proﬁles, and 26–40 \% less than those of a retrieval using monthly averaged high-spatial-resolution proﬁles.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing may be a useful tool for exploring spatial variability of air pollution exposure within an urban area. To evaluate the extent to which satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) can resolve urban-scale gradients in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) within a large urban area, we compared estimates of surface NO2 concentrations derived from OMI measurements and US EPA ambient monitoring stations. OMI, aboard NASA’s Aura satellite, provides daily afternoon (w13:30 local time) measurements of NO2 tropospheric column abundance. We used scaling factors (surface-to-column ratios) to relate satellite column measurements to ground-level concentrations. We compared 4138 sets of paired data for 25 monitoring stations in the South Coast Air Basin of California for all of 2005. OMI measurements include more data gaps than the ground monitors (60\% versus 5\% of available data, respectively), owing to cloud contamination and imposed limits on pixel size. The spatial correlation between OMI columns and corrected in situ measurements is strong (r ¼ 0.93 for annual average data), indicating that the within-urban spatial signature of surface NO2 is well resolved by the satellite sensor. Satellite-based surface estimates employing scaling factors from an urban model provide a reliable measure (annual mean bias: À13\%; seasonal mean bias: {\textless}1\% [spring] to À22\% [fall]) of ﬁne-scale surface NO2. We also ﬁnd that OMI provides good spatial density in the study region (average area [km2] per measurement: 730 for the satellite sensor vs. 1100 for the monitors). Our ﬁndings indicate that satellite observations of NO2 from the OMI sensor provide a reliable measure of spatial variability in ground-level NO2 exposure for a large urban area.},

The aim is to cover a broad range of methods having differing levels of complexity and strength of the required assumptions. Simple approaches that form the elementary building blocks of more advanced approaches are discussed first. Then, special attention is devoted to methods that rely on readily available auxiliary variables (e.g., repeated measurements, indicators, or instrumental variables). Results relaxing most of the commonly invoked simplifying assumptions are presented (linear measurement structure, independent errors, zero-mean errors, availability of auxiliary information). This article also provides an overview of important connections with related fields, such as latent variable models, nonlinear panel data, factor models, and set identification, and applications of the methods to other fields traditionally unrelated to measurement error models.},

The proposed method consists of running a regression of the (recentered) influence function (RIF) of the unconditional quantile on the explanatory variables. The influence function is a widely used tool in robust estimation that can easily be computed for each quantile of interest. We show how standard partial effects, as well as policy effects, can be estimated using our regression approach. We propose three different regression estimators based on a standard OLS regression (RIF-OLS), a logit regression (RIF-Logit), and a nonparametric logit regression (RIF-OLS). We also discuss how our approach can be generalized to other distributional statistics besides quantiles.},

This project links administrative Census microdata to newly available, spatially continuous high resolution measures of ambient particulate pollution (PM2.5) to examine the underlying causes and consequences of differences in Black-White pollution exposures. We begin by decomposing differences in pollution exposure into components explained by observable population characteristics (e.g., income) versus those that remain unexplained. We then use quantile regression methods to show that a significant portion of the “unexplained” convergence in Black-White pollution exposure can be attributed to differential impacts of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in African American and non-Hispanic White communities. Areas with larger Black populations saw greater CAA-related declines in PM2.5 exposure. We show that the CAA has been the single largest contributor to racial convergence in PM2.5 pollution exposure in the U.S. since 2000 accounting for over 60 percent of the reduction.},

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases.},

	abstract = {The United States has a unique legal
relationship with federally‐recognized
Indian tribes (tribe or tribes) based on the
Constitution, treaties, statutes, executive
orders, and court decisions. This
government‐to‐government relationship
includes recognition of the right of tribes as
sovereign governments to self‐
determination and an acknowledgement of
the federal government’s trust
responsibility to tribes.
Today there are over 560 separate
federally‐recognized tribal governments
throughout the United States. Of these
tribes, approximately 200 have active or
closed federally‐regulated underground
storage tanks (USTs or tanks) on their lands.
There are currently about 2,600 active USTs
in Indian country and many tribes have
their own UST programs. The extent and
nature of these tribal programs vary though
depending upon such factors as the number
of tanks, funding sources, and experience
The U.S. Environmental Protection with other environmental programs.  
Agency (EPA or Agency) is committed to
strengthening its partnership with tribes
and supporting tribal governments in
protecting human health and the
environment in Indian country. In 1984,
EPA became the first federal agency to
adopt a formal Indian Policy of working
with tribes on a government‐to‐government
basis. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson
reaffirmed the Agency’s commitment to this
policy in 2005.
In addition, each tribe has its own
history and culture and therefore, tribal
governments cannot be viewed or treated as
one group. The distribution of tanks in
Indian country also varies widely, with
many tribes having only a small number of
tanks. This cultural and programmatic
diversity makes the UST program in Indian
country complex to implement.

On August 8, 2005, President Bush
signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
Section 1529 of the Act, which amended
Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act by
adding a new section 9013, directed EPA to
submit a report to Congress summarizing
the Agency’s progress implementing and
enforcing the UST program on all lands
under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe.
This report fulfills EPA’s obligation to
Congress under section 9013 and provides
information on the background, prevention,
cleanup, successes, and future of the UST
program in Indian country.},

	abstract = {The impact of insurer competition on welfare, negotiated provider prices, and premiums in the U.S. private health care industry is theoretically ambiguous. Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospitalinsurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10\% across markets.},

as well as what we call mental gaps resulting from wrong priors/worldviews, or relevant features of a problem not being top of mind. Most research studying such losses 
does not empirically distinguish between these mechanisms. Instead, we show that most highly cited papers in this area presume one mechanism underlies consumer 
choices and assume away other potential explanations, or collapse many mechanisms together. We discuss the empirical difficulties that arise in distinguishing between 
different mechanisms, and some promising approaches for making progress in doing so. We also assess when it is more or less important for researchers to distinguish 
between these mechanisms. Approaches that seek to identify true value from demand, without specifying mechanisms behind this wedge, are most useful when researchers 
are interested in evaluating allocation policies that strongly steer consumers towards better options with regulation, traditional policy instruments, and defaults. On the 
other hand, understanding the precise mechanisms underlying consumer losses is essential to predicting the impact of mechanism policies aimed primarily at reducing 
specific frictions or mental gaps without otherwise steering consumers. We make the case that papers engaging with these questions empirically should be clear about 
whether their analyses distinguish between mechanisms behind poorly informed choices, and what that implies for the questions they can answer. We present examples 
from several empirical contexts to highlight these distinctions.},

We investigate the welfare implications of these regulations with an emphasis on two potential sources of inefficiency: (i) adverse selection and (ii) premium reclassification risk. We find substantial adverse selection leading to full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even when age can be priced. While the welfare cost of adverse selection is substantial when health status cannot be priced, that of reclassification risk is five times larger when insurers can price based on some health status information. We investigate several extensions including (i) contract design regulation, (ii) self-insurance through saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk adjustment transfers.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

made useful progress in measuring broad trends in markups. However, industries are so heterogeneous that careful industry-specific studies are also required, and 
sorely needed. Examples of such studies illustrate differing explanations for rising markups, including endogenous increases in fixed costs associated with lower 
marginal costs. In some industries there is evidence of price increases driven by mergers. To fully understand markups, we must eventually recover the key economic 
primitives of demand, marginal cost, and fixed and sunk costs. We end by discussing the various aspects of antitrust enforcement that may be of increasing 
importance regardless of the cause of increased markups.},

	abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a "credibility revolution" in applied econometrics.  One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of "structural methods"; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates "treatment effects" based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where "progress is less dramatic." Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in fields such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.},

First, many polluting activities are difficult to tax because they are not market transactions, and so recent papers have shown that the same effects can be achieved by use of a two-part instrument (2PI): a tax on output or income and a subsidy for clean alternatives to pollution. It is a generalization of a deposit–refund system (DRS). Second, a different literature concerns the second-best pollution tax in the presence of other tax distortions. Here, we combine the two extensions by looking at the second-best 2PI. When government needs revenue, is the deposit larger and the rebate smaller? We find explicit solutions for each tax and subsidy in a general equilibrium model with other tax distortions, and we compare these to the rates in a first-best model. The tax–subsidy combination is explained in terms of a tax effect, an environmental effect and a revenue effect. The model allows for flexible interpretation to show various applications of the 2PI.

A presumptive tax is a tax that is imposed under the presumption that all production uses a dirty technology or all consumption goods become waste.  The environmental subsidy is then provided only to the extent that production uses a cleaner technology or that consumption goods are recycled.  To analyze the usefulness of the tax-subsidy combination, we review conceptual considerations regarding its implementation and practical considerations regarding its actual use throughout the world. While the tax-subsidy combination is increasingly being used, in the form of a deposit-refund system, we argue that more flexible interpretations are important to explore.  The two parts of such a policy do not have to apply to the same side of the market. The tax and subsidy do not have to equal one another, and they can apply to different goods altogether.  Compared to the Pigovian tax, a two-part instrument may be easier to enforce, may be easier to enact, and can still force the market to recognize the social cost of disposal.},

Existing research tends to focus on particular contexts, such as water or air quality, fisheries, or land use. This paper discusses unifying themes of group performance policies, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We discuss a range of specific policy instruments, including group-based taxes, subsidies, and fixed penalties. We show how, in principle, group-based policies can be designed to achieve efficient provision of group-level environmental performance; however, in some cases, group policies can lead to suboptimal outcomes. We discuss the incentives for collaboration that can arise when regulators impose group performance policies, and the role that it can play in promoting efficient outcomes. We argue that the success of group-based policies will depend both on how the policy is designed (i.e., the external rewards and penalties) and on how the group operates. This implies potential complementarities between “top-down” regulatory interventions based on group performance and “bottom-up” within-group incentives for self-governance. Our discussion suggests that group performance policies should play a more prominent role in the suite of policy instruments considered by scholars and policymakers concerned with ENR management.},

Where everyone is producing the same externality, a uniform price (in excess of marginal cost by the value of the externality) permits the competitive equilibrium to be Pareto optimal. Where individuals give rise to different externalities, but a uniform price is in effect, we have a second-best situation. When demands depend only on price, price should exceed marginal cost by a weighted average of externalities generated, the weights being the price derivatives of demand. When demands also depend on congestion, the optimal price generally diverges from this rule. The price should be lower when the individuals giving large external diseconomies per unit demanded tend to be price insensitive and congestion sensitive in their demands (relative to the average). In this case public expenditures to decrease congestion directly should not be carried to the point where the marginal direct benefit from congestion reduction equals the marginal cost.

	abstract = {A common objection to "sin taxes"—corrective taxes on goods that are thought to be overconsumed, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary drinks—is that they often fall disproportionately on low-income consumers. This paper studies the interaction between corrective and redistributive motives in a general optimal taxation framework and delivers empirically implementable formulas for sufficient statistics for the optimal commodity tax. The optimal sin tax is increasing in the price elasticity of demand, increasing in the degree to which lower-income consumers are more biased or more elastic to the tax, decreasing in the extent to which consumption is concentrated among the poor, and decreasing in income effects, because income effects imply that commodity taxes create labor supply distortions. Contrary to common intuitions, stronger preferences for redistribution can increase the optimal sin tax, if lower-income consumers are more responsive to taxes or are more biased. As an application, we estimate the optimal nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, using Nielsen Homescan data and a specially designed survey measuring nutrition knowledge and self-control. Holding federal income tax rates constant, our estimates imply an optimal federal sugar-sweetened beverage tax of 1 to 2.1 cents per ounce, although optimal city-level taxes could be as much as 60\% lower due to cross-border shopping.},

Precise targeting of compensating transfers, however, may not be possible when agents are heterogeneous and the planner faces constraints on the design of transfers. In this paper, I derive a necessary condition for an efficiency-enhancing policy to create a Pareto improvement that can be tested directly with data. The condition relates the size of efficiency gains to the degree of predictability between initial burdens and variables used to determine a transfer scheme. The main empirical application is to a gasoline tax to correct carbon emissions, with related results for other sin taxes also presented. Results indicate that it is infeasible to create a Pareto improvement from the taxation of these goods, and moreover that plausible policies are likely to leave a large fraction of households as net losers. The paper argues that the existence of these losers is relevant to policy design and may help explain the political challenges faced by many efficient policies. The paper concludes with several extensions related to this political economy motivation.},

We use tax return data to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of program recipients. We find that these tax expenditures have gone predominantly to higher-income Americans. The bottom three income quintiles have received about 10\% of all credits, while the top quintile has received about 60\%. The most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles, where we find that the top income quintile has received about 90\% of all credits. By comparing to previous work on the distributional consequences of pricing greenhouse gas emissions, we conclude that tax credits are likely to be much less attractive on distributional grounds than market mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs).},

Our results suggest that carbon taxes are more regressive when annual income is used as a measure of economic welfare than when lifetime income measures are used. Further, the direct component of the tax, in any given year, is significantly more regressive than the indirect component. We observe a modest shift over time with the direct component of carbon taxes becoming lass regressive and the indirect component becoming more regressive. These effects mostly offset each other and the distribution of the total tax burden has not changed much over time. In addition we find that regional variation has fluctuated over the years of our analysis. By 2003 there is little systematic variation in carbon tax burdens across regions of the country.},

For example, is the optimal extent of public goods provision smaller than indicated by the Samuelson rule because finance is distortionary? Or should environmental regulations fail to internalize externalities fully if the incidence of the regulations is regressive? It is suggested that these questions are best addressed by considering distribution-neutral implementation, in which budget balance is achieved by choosing an adjustment to the income tax that offsets the distributive impact of the policy in question. In basic cases, both distribution and labor supply distortion are moot because the target policy and the tax adjustment produce offsetting effects on each. Thus, traditional first-best principles provide good benchmarks for policy analysis after all. Moreover, even when actual implementation will not be distribution neutral in aggregate, distribution-neutral policy analysis has many conceptual and practical virtues that render it quite useful to investigators.},

	title = {For {Whom} the {Bridge} {Tolls}: {Congestion}, {Air} {Pollution}, and {Second}-{Best} {Road} {Pricing} (working paper)},
	abstract = {Cities are increasingly adopting road pricing policies to address the congestion and air pollution externalities associated with urban driving. A ﬁrst-best road pricing scheme would charge drivers according to the social damages associated with each trip. In practice, road pricing often takes the form of cordon zones — regions in the center of a city where road users are charged for entry. These pricing schemes deviate from the ﬁrst-best policy in two key ways: First, feasible cordon systems cannot account for all of the heterogeneity in trip-level externalities. Second, cordon zones leave nearby roads unpriced, allowing for externality leakage. As a result, it is generally unclear how to optimally set cordon prices. In this paper, I adapt models from public ﬁnance to demonstrate how to optimally set cordon prices in the face of these policy imperfections. Calculating optimal prices requires information about (i) the heterogeneity in marginal trip-level externalities, (ii) the relationship between these externalities and individual price-responsiveness, and (iii) the elasticity of substitution between priced and unpriced trips. I then use administrative microdata from bridge tolls in the San Francisco Bay Area to back out each of these parameters. Armed with this model of urban driving demand, I calculate optimal prices for planned cordon zones in three cities ––– San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. In each city, I ﬁnd that leakage drives optimal peak-hour prices (\$2-7) well below average social damages (\$4-12). Due to the blunt nature of cordon pricing, these policies are relatively ineﬀective at internalizing congestion and pollution externalities. In these three cities, I estimate that second-best optimal cordon prices recover 15 to 40\% of the welfare gains that would be achieved under an ideal Pigouvian policy. To conclude, I discuss the prospects for improving the performance of congestion pricing through expanding spatial coverage or allowing for granular time-of-day pricing.},

The costs per avoided ton of emissions are approximately twice as high once such offsets are recognized. Such offsets (or “leakage”) reflect interactions between the state-level initiatives and the federal fuel-economy standard: the state-level efforts effectively loosen the national standard, giving automakers scope to profitably increase sales of high-emissions automobiles in non-adopting states. Although the state-level efforts spur invention of fuel- and emissions-saving technologies, interactions with the federal standard limit the nationwide emissions reductions from such advances. Our multi-period simulation model estimates that a recent state-federal agreement avoids what would have been 74\% leakage in the first phase of the state-level effort, and that potential for 65\% leakage remains for the second phase. This research confronts a general issue of policy significance—namely, problems from “nested” state and federal environmental regulations. Similar leakage difficulties would arise under several newly proposed state-level initiatives.},

The framework leads to new insights about the magnitude of rebound when goods are not priced at marginal cost and when consumers are imperfect optimizers, as well as the role of technological progress in rebound. I then explore the implications of this framework with illustrative calculations for improved auto fuel economy and lighting efﬁciency. These suggest that rebound is unlikely to more than offset the savings from energy efﬁciency investments (known as “backﬁre”), but rebound likely reduces the net savings by roughly 10\% to 40\% from these energy efﬁciency improvements.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty about compliance costs causes otherwise equivalent price and quantity controls to behave differently and leads to divergent welfare consequences. Although most of the debate on global climate change policy has focused on quantity controls due to their political appeal, this paper argues that price controls are more efficient. Simulations based on a stochastic computable general equilibrium model indicate that the expected welfare gain from the optimal price policy is five times higher than the expected gain from the optimal quantity policy. An alternative hybrid policy combines both the political appeal of quantity controls with the efficiency of prices, using an initial distribution of tradeable permits to set a quantitative target, but allowing additional permits to be purchased at a fixed “trigger” price. Even sub-optimal hybrid policies offer dramatic efficiency improvements over otherwise standard quantity controls. For example, a \$50 trigger price per ton of carbon converts the \$3 trillion expected loss associated with a simple 1990 emission target to a \$150 billion gain. These results suggest that a hybrid policy is an attractive alternative to either a pure price or quantity system.},

	abstract = {This article presents the case for using a cap and trade program (i.e., tradable permits) to control U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis draws two basic distinctions between such an approach and a carbon tax (the alternative favored by many economists). The first concerns how the value of emissions is allocated. Under cap and trade, the government can capture the value of emissions by auctioning permits or by freely distributing allowances to emitters. A carbon tax would generally capture the entire value as revenue. While free distribution has efficiency costs, it gives policy-makers important flexibility to resolve distributional issues. The second distinction is that a tradable permit system sets the quantity of allowable emissions, while a tax sets the price. In the context of international policy, cap and trade promotes cost-effective abatement and broad participation. A quantity approach may also be preferred on efficiency grounds. Although the prevailing view among economists is that uncertainty about marginal costs favors taxes, that view ignores the possibility of allowance banking and borrowing, and overlooks growing scientific evidence that climate change will be highly nonlinear and characterized by “tipping points.” A simple thought experiment illustrates how a prices-versus-quantities argument might favour cap and trade.},

These include the setting of the limit on access, the initial allocation of rights, transferability rules (both among participants and across time) as well as procedures for monitoring and enforcement. It continues by examining how these  design questions have been answered by these three applications and how the answers have been influenced by changing technology, increased familiarity with the system and a desire to respond to some of the controversies surrounding the use of these approaches. The hard evidence on the economic and environmental  consequences of adopting these approaches is juxtaposed with the expectations created by the economic theory of tradable permits. The final section draws together some tentative lessons that can be drawn from this experience.},

This literature has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of reduced-form elasticities rather than structural primitives. I present a general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by estimating a small set of sufficient statistics using program-evaluation methods. I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral welfare economics. Finally, I discuss problems in macroeconomics, labor, development, and industrial organization that could be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.},

	abstract = {Physically, pollution occurs because it is virtually impossible to have a productive process that involves no waste; economically, pollution occurs because polluting is less expensive than operating cleanly. This chapter explores the sources and consequences of, and remedies for, pollution and associated environmental damages. If all goods had well-defined property rights and could be traded in markets, environmental goods would be no different than other goods; however, markets fail for these goods because property rights cannot or do not exist and because of the nonexclusive, nonrival nature of these goods. Thus, environmental goods provide the classic case where government intervention can increase efficiency. Achieving efficient levels of pollution involves charging per unit of pollution based on damages caused by that unit. In practice, this policy can be difficult to achieve, due to difficulties in measuring and differentiating damages by source, difficulties in monitoring and enforcing pollution policies, and the financial and political costs of pollution taxes. Additionally, pre-existing market distortions influence the nature of efficient pollution abatement strategies. Thus, many regulatory approaches that do not achieve first-best outcomes may be used because their technological or political feasibility is superior. Market-based instruments provide flexibility to polluters, while command-and-control (standards-based) approaches limit choice, often through an emissions limit or a technology requirement. Market-based approaches typically achieve a specified level of emissions with lower abatement costs than standards, but their greater efficiency may not hold in the presence of the problems mentioned above. Non-regulatory approaches to pollution control include the use of liability law to define and enforce property rights and some voluntary pollution control initiatives by polluters. While these approaches can play an important role, they are unlikely to achieve adequate provision of environmental goods.},

Our solution involves specifying counterfactual shocks that may as well have been realized and adjusting for a summary measure of non-randomness in shock exposure: the average treatment (or instrument) across such counterfactuals. We further show how to use shock counterfactuals for valid finite-sample inference, and characterize the valid instruments that are asymptotically efficient. We apply this framework to address bias when estimating employment effects of market access growth from Chinese high-speed rail construction, and to boost power when estimating coverage effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility.},

	abstract = {Consider the following “inverse stochastic control” problem. A statistician observes a realization of a controlled stochastic process \${\textbackslash}\{ d\_t ,x\_t {\textbackslash}\} \$ consisting of the sequence of states \$x\_t\$, and decisions \$d\_t\$ of an agent at times \$t = 1, {\textbackslash}cdots ,T\$. The null hypothesis is that the agent’s behavior is generated from the solution to a Markovian decision problem. The inverse problem is to use the data \${\textbackslash}\{ d\_t ,x\_t {\textbackslash}\} \$ to go backward and “uncover” the agent's objective function U, and his beliefs about the law of motion of the state variables p. The problem is complicated by the fact that the statistician generally only observes a subset \$x\_t\$ of the state variables \$(x\_t ,{\textbackslash}eta \_t )\$ observed by the agent. This paper formulates the inverse problem as a problem of statistical inference, explicitly accounting for unobserved state variables\${\textbackslash}eta \_t \$, in order to produce a nondegenerate and internally consistent statistical model. Specifically, the functions U and p are assumed to depend on a vector of unknown parameters \${\textbackslash}theta \$ known by the agent but not by the statistician. The agent’s preferences and expectations are uncovered by finding a parameter vector \${\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \$ that maximizes the likelihood function for the observed sample of data. The difficulty is that neither the dynamic programming problem nor the associated likelihood function has an a priori known functional form. In general the solution is only described recursively via Bellman’s “principle of optimality.” This paper derives a nested fixed-point maximum likelihood algorithm that computes e and the associated value function \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \} \$ for a class of discrete control processes\$(d\_t ,x\_t )\$, where the control variable \$d\_t\$ is restricted to a finite set of alternatives. Given M independent realizations of \$(d\_t ,x\_t )\$ for T time periods, it is shown that 8 converges to the true parameter \${\textbackslash}theta {\textasciicircum} * \$ with probability 1 and has an asymptotic Gaussian distribution as M (or the number of periods T) approaches infinity. Uniform convergence of the algorithm is established by showing that the estimated value function \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}theta \} \$ (a random element in a Banach space B) converges with probability 1 to the true value function and has an asymptotic Gaussian distribution in B.},

The Industrial Revolution caused an epidemic of metal intoxication, urging scientists and physician of that period to study and identify specific symptoms and organ alterations related to chronic lead poisoning. During the 20th century, the acknowledgment of occupational and environmental toxicity of lead fostered public awareness and legislation to protect health. More recently, the identification of sub-clinical effects have greatly modified the concept of lead poisoning and the approaches of medicine towards this condition. Nowadays, lead poisoning is rarely seen in developed countries, but it still represents a major environmental problem in certain areas. Consequently, it may appear as a paradigm of "occupational and environmental disease," and the history of this condition seems to parallel the historical development of modern "Occupational and Environmental Health" as a more complete medical discipline.},

I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between \$810M and \$3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent firms.},

We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency. We discuss and illustrate several practical insights of this framework in the setting of Autor et al.

	abstract = {Summary. An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through its manipulation of the treatment. For instance, encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit consistent estimation of the effects caused by the treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized experiment assigning some subjects to ‘encouragement to exercise’ and others to ‘no encouragement’ but, for reasons of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement; none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e. instruments that have only a slight effect on the treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a recent proposal for permutation inference with an instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound, Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which correct answers are known and finally using statistical theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as well as with long-tailed responses.},

However, previous simulations suggest that this approach does not always eliminate or reduce bias, and it is not clear when and why. Using Medicaid claims data from Oregon, we systematically vary the distribution of two key unobservables—fixed effects and the random error term—to examine how they affect bias of matching on pre-treatment outcomes levels or trends combined with difference-in-differences. We find that in most scenarios, bias increases with the standard deviation of the error term because a higher standard deviation makes short-term fluctuations in outcomes more likely, and matching cannot easily distinguish between these short-term fluctuations and more structural outcome trends. The fixed effect distribution may also create bias, but only when matching on pre-treatment outcome levels. A parallel-trend test on the matched sample does not reliably distinguish between successful and unsuccessful matching. Researchers using matching on pre-treatment outcomes to adjust for non-parallel trends should report estimates from both unadjusted and propensity-score matching adjusted difference-in-differences, compare results for matching on outcome levels and trends and examine outcome changes around intervention begin to assess remaining bias.},

	abstract = {Summary. Many scientific problems require that treatment comparisons be adjusted for posttreatment variables, but the estimands underlying standard methods are not causal effects. To address this deficiency, we propose a general framework for comparing treatments adjusting for posttreatment variables that yields principal effects based on principal stratification. Principal stratification with respect to a posttreatment variable is a cross-classification of subjects defined by the joint potential values of that posttreatment variable under each of the treatments being compared. Principal effects are causal effects within a principal stratum. The key property of principal strata is that they are not affected by treatment assignment and therefore can be used just as any pretreatment covariate, such as age category. As a result, the central property of our principal effects is that they are always causal effects and do not suffer from the complications of standard posttreatment-adjusted estimands. We discuss briefly that such principal causal effects are the link between three recent applications with adjustment for posttreatment variables: (i) treatment noncompliance, (ii) missing outcomes (dropout) following treatment noncompliance, and (iii) censoring by death. We then attack the problem of surrogate or biomarker endpoints, where we show, using principal causal effects, that all current definitions of surrogacy, even when perfectly true, do not generally have the desired interpretation as causal effects of treatment on outcome. We go on to formulate estimands based on principal stratification and principal causal effects and show their superiority.},

The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data.

Entropy balancing relies on a maximum entropy reweighting scheme that calibrates unit weights so that the reweighted treatment and control group satisfy a potentially large set of prespecified balance conditions that incorporate information about known sample moments. Entropy balancing thereby exactly adjusts inequalities in representation with respect to the first, second, and possibly higher moments of the covariate distributions. These balance improvements can reduce model dependence for the subsequent estimation of treatment effects. The method assures that balance improves on all covariate moments included in the reweighting. It also obviates the need for continual balance checking and iterative searching over propensity score models that may stochastically balance the covariate moments. We demonstrate the use of entropy balancing with Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications.},

Using detailed ﬁrm-level data and diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences research designs, we show that regulated ﬁrms cut output and shifted some production to unregulated ﬁrms in the same conglomerate instead of improving their energy eﬃciency. To account for conglomerate and market spillovers, we interpret these results through the lens of an industry equilibrium model featuring conglomerate production. We quantify that a \$160 social cost of carbon rationalizes the policy and that alternative polices that exploit public information on business networks can increase aggregate energy savings by 10\%.},

Journals demand more revisions, and papers have become bloated with numerous robustness checks and extensions. Even if the extra resulting revisions do on average lead to improved papers—a claim that is debatable—the cost is enormous. We argue that much of the time involved in these revisions is a waste of research effort. Another cause for concern is the level of disagreement amongst referees, a pattern that suggests a high level of arbitrariness in the review process. To identify and highlight what is going right and what is going wrong in the reviewing process, we wrote to a sample of former editors of the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Econometrica, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics, and asked them for their thoughts about what might improve the process. We found a rough consensus that referees for top journals in economics tend to make similar, correctable mistakes. The italicized quotations throughout this paper are drawn from our correspondence with these editors and our own experience. Their insights are consistent with our own experiences as editors at the Journal of Finance and the Review of Financial Studies. Our objective is to highlight these mistakes and provide a roadmap for how to avoid them.},

For models with statistical significance levels determined via randomization models of inference and for which there is no standard error or confidence intervals for the estimate itself, these plots appear less useful. In this article, I illustrate a variant of the coefficient plot for regression models with p-values constructed using permutation tests. These visualizations plot each estimate’s p-value and its associated confidence interval in relation to a specified alpha level. These plots can help the analyst interpret and report the statistical and substantive significances of their models.

	abstract = {Can machine learning improve human decision making? Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7\% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9\% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.},

Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions—the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes—and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.},

This effect is explained by short-term suppression of pollution on monitored days, especially during high-pollution periods when the city’s noncompliance risk is high. Cities’ use of air quality warnings increases on monitored days, which suggests local governments’ role in coordinating emission reductions.},

We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by 0.17 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate over our study period relative to untreated areas.

This difference in trade policy creates a global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions in internationally traded goods and contributes to climate change. This global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions totals several hundred billion dollars annually. The greater protection of downstream industries, which are relatively clean, substantially accounts for this pattern. The downstream pattern can be explained by theories where industries lobby for low tariffs on their inputs but final consumers are poorly organized. A quantitative general equilibrium model suggests that if countries applied similar trade policies to clean and dirty goods, global CO2 emissions would decrease and global real income would change little.},

	abstract = {PurpleAir sensors which measure particulate matter (PM) are widely used by individuals, community groups, and other organizations including state and local air monitoring agencies. PurpleAir sensors comprise a massive global network of more than 10,000 sensors. Previous performance evaluations have typically studied a limited number of PurpleAir sensors in 15 small geographic areas or laboratory environments. While useful for determining sensor behavior and data normalization for these geographic areas, little work has been done to understand the broad applicability of these results outside these regions and conditions. Here, PurpleAir sensors operated by air quality monitoring agencies are evaluated in comparison to collocated ambient air quality regulatory instruments. In total, almost 12,000 24-hour averaged PM2.5 measurements from collocated PurpleAir sensors and Federal Reference Method (FRM) or Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 measurements were 20 collected across diverse regions of the United States (U.S.), including 16 states. Consistent with previous evaluations, under typical ambient and smoke impacted conditions, the raw data from PurpleAir sensors overestimate PM2.5 concentrations by about 40\% in most parts of the U.S. A simple linear regression reduces much of this bias across most U.S. regions, but adding a relative humidity term further reduces the bias and improves consistency in the biases between different regions. More complex multiplicative models did not substantially improve results when tested on an independent dataset. The final PurpleAir 25 correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the raw data from 8 µg m-3 to 3 µg m-3 with an average FRM or FEM concentration of 9 µg m-3. This correction equation, along with proposed data cleaning criteria, has been applied to PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements across the U.S. in the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map (fire.airnow.gov) and has the potential to be successfully used in other air quality and public health applications.},

	abstract = {Until recently air quality, including wildfire impacts, have been determined by permanent stationary regulatory monitors that are used to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI). Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors, specifically PurpleAir sensors, have found widespread use by the public, especially in smoke impacted areas, but comparability to regulatory monitors is often a concern.  The EPA Office of Research and Development has worked to develop a U.S.-wide correction equation for PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors and has validated the performance of the correction equation even during smoke impacted times.  This presentation will review the process by which the U.S.-wide correction equation was developed, discuss additional work to validate the performance of the correction equation smoke impacted sites, and will discuss known/suspected issues and some of the commonly expressed QA/QC concerns of this crowdsourced data.  The presentation will briefly discuss how the U.S.-wide correction works for a few international datasets and key considerations in extrapolating this work with other PM sensors. Lower cost air sensors are increasingly used to report air quality and smoke concentrations from wildfires, but the accuracy of these measurement under ambient and smoke conditions is largely unknown. This work briefly summarizes work to evaluate a popular low-cost PM2.5 sensor (PurpleAir) across the U.S and to develop a correction equation that can improve the accuracy of reported concentrations, even during smoke impacted times.  This presentation seeks to inform users of the AirNow smoke and fire map how the PurpleAir correction was developed and some of the limitations and considerations one must make when using the map.

This paper builds a framework to detect whether local governments skip air pollution monitoring when they expect air quality to deteriorate. The core of our method tests whether the timing of monitor shutdowns coincides with the counties’ air quality alerts – public advisories based on local governments’ own pollution forecasts. Applying the method to a monitor in Jersey City, NJ, suspected of a deliberate shutdown during the 2013 “Bridgegate” traffic jam, we find a 33\% reduction of this monitor’s sampling rate on pollution-alert days. Building on large-scale inference tools, we then apply the method to test more than 1,300 monitors across the U.S., finding 14 metro areas with clusters of monitors showing similar strategic behavior. We assess geometric imputation and remote-sensing technologies as potential solutions to deter future strategic monitoring.},

We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

            This article estimates the effect of environmental regulation on firm productivity using a spatial regression discontinuity design implicit in China's water quality monitoring system. Because water quality readings are important for political evaluations and the monitoring stations only capture emissions from their upstream regions, local government officials are incentivized to enforce tighter environmental standards on firms immediately upstream of a monitoring station, rather than those immediately downstream. Exploiting this discontinuity in regulation stringency with novel firm-level geocoded emission and production data sets, we find that immediate upstream polluters face a more than 24\% reduction in total factor productivity (TFP), and a more than 57\% reduction in chemical oxygen demand emissions, as compared with their immediate downstream counterparts. We find that the discontinuity in TFP does not exist in nonpolluting industries, only emerged after the government explicitly linked political promotion to water quality readings, and was predominantly driven by prefectural cities with career-driven leaders. Linking the TFP estimate with the emission estimate, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that China's water regulation efforts between 2000 and 2007 were associated with an economic cost of more than 800 billion Chinese yuan.},

We use the most comprehensive set of files ever compiled on water pollution and its determinants, including 50 million pollution readings from 240,000 monitoring sites and a network model of all U.S. rivers, to study water pollution’s trends, causes, and welfare consequences. We have three main findings. First, water pollution concentrations have fallen substantially. Between 1972 and 2001, for example, the share of waters safe for fishing grew by 12 percentage points. Second, the Clean Water Act’s grants to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which account for \$\{{\textbackslash}\$\}\$650 billion in expenditure, caused some of these declines.

Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data. Satellite data on growth in night-time lights along rivers show that local authorities allow more settlements to develop close to rivers in the downstream portions of counties, which is the likely underlying mechanism. The border effects on pollution are not as pronounced when the cost of inter-jurisdictional coordination is lower.},

Travel-cost based revealed preference estimates of households' valuations are much smaller than both stated preference valuations and health planners' valuations, and are consistent with models in which the demand for health is highly income elastic.

Using as controls authorities that were proposed but never approved by Congress, we find that the TVA led to large gains in agricultural employment that were eventually reversed when the program’s subsidies ended. Gains in manufacturing employment, by contrast, continued to intensify well after federal transfers had lapsed—a pattern consistent with the presence of agglomeration economies in manufacturing. Because manufacturing paid higher wages than agriculture, this shift raised aggregate income in the TVA region for an extended period of time. Economists have long cautioned that the local gains created by place-based policies may be offset by losses elsewhere. We develop a structured approach to assessing the TVA’s aggregate consequences that is applicable to other place-based policies. In our model, the TVA affects the national economy both directly through infrastructure improvements and indirectly through agglomeration economies. The model’s estimates suggest that the TVA’s direct investments yielded a significant increase in national manufacturing productivity, with benefits exceeding the program’s costs. However, the program’s indirect effects appear to have been limited: agglomeration gains in the TVA region were offset by losses in the rest of the country. Spillovers in manufacturing appear to be the rare example of a localized market failure that cancels out in the aggregate.},

The annual reductions in pharmaceutical purchases, a key defensive investment, and mortality are valued at about \$800 million and \$1.3 billion, respectively, suggesting that defenses are over one-third of willingness-to-pay for reductions in NOx emissions. Further, estimates indicate that the NBP's benefits easily exceed its costs and that NOx reductions have substantial benefits.},

It embeds a boundary discontinuity design in a heterogeneous residential choice model, addressing the endogeneity of school and neighborhood characteristics. The model is estimated using restricted‐access Census data from a large metropolitan area, yielding a number of new results. First, households are willing to pay less than 1 percent more in house prices—substantially lower than previous estimates—when the average performance of the local school increases by 5 percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks live in unobservably lower‐quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with households preferring to self‐segregate on the basis of both race and education.},

The continuing premise for the book is that estimates of the economic values of environmental and natural resource services are essential for effective policy-making. As previous editions, the third edition, which includes two additional co-authors, presents a comprehensive treatment of the theory and methods involved in estimating environmental benefits.  
Researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners will welcome the work as an up-to-date reference on recent developments. Students will gain a better understanding of the contribution that economics as a discipline can make to decisions concerning pollution control and human health, recreation, environmental amenities, and other critical issues concerning the way we use and interact with environmental and natural resource systems. To reflect recent progress in both the theory and practice of non-market valuation, the third edition includes more details on empirical approaches to measurement, expanded discussion of the reasons for divergence between "willingness to pay" and "willingness to accept compensation," and increased coverage of econometric issues encountered in estimation. In keeping with its cutting edge orientation, it also includes more discussion of survey design, equilibrium sorting models, and the implications of behavioral economics for welfare measurements and benefit cost analysis.},

Second, the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day–related fatalities. Third, using Dubin and McFadden’s discrete-continuous model, the present value of US consumer surplus from the introduction of residential air conditioning is estimated to be \$85–\$185 billion (2012 dollars).},

The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a surge in econometric work focusing on estimating average treatment effects under various sets of assumptions. One strand of this literature has developed methods for estimating average treatment effects for a binary treatment under assumptions variously described as exogeneity, unconfoundedness, or selection on observables. The implication of these assumptions is that systematic (for example, average or distributional) differences in outcomes between treated and control units with the same values for the covariates are attributable to the treatment. Recent analysis has considered estimation and inference for average treatment effects under weaker assumptions than typical of the earlier literature by avoiding distributional and functional-form assumptions. Various methods of semiparametric estimation have been proposed, including estimating the unknown regression functions, matching, methods using the propensity score such as weighting and blocking,
and combinations of these approaches. In this paper I review the state of this literature and discuss some of its unanswered questions, focusing in particular on the practical implementation of these methods, the plausibility of this exogeneity assumption in economic applications, the relative performance of the various semiparametric estimators when the key assumptions (unconfoundedness and overlap) are satisfied, alternative estimands such as quantile treatment effects, and alternate methods such as Bayesian inference.},

The idea of the approach is that the welfare effect of policy changes can be expressed in terms of estimable reduced-form elasticities, allowing for policy evaluation without estimating the structural primitives of fully specified models. The approach relies on three assumptions: that policy changes are small, that government policy is the only source of market imperfection, and that a set of high-level restrictions on the environment and on preferences can be used to reduce the number of elasticities to be estimated. We generalize the approach in all three dimensions. It is possible to develop transparent sufficient statistics formulas under very general conditions, but the estimation requirements increase greatly. Starting from such general formulas elucidates that feasible empirical implementations are in fact structural approaches.},

Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias. We derive an implementable alternative to the simple formula. This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.},

	abstract = {The debate between structural and reduced-form approaches has generated substantial controversy in applied economics. This article reviews a recent literature in public economics that combines the advantages of reduced-form strategies—transparent and credible identification—with an important advantage of structural models—the ability to make predictions about counterfactual outcomes and welfare. This literature has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of reduced-form elasticities rather than structural primitives. I present a general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by estimating a small set of sufficient statistics using program-evaluation methods. I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral welfare economics. Finally, I discuss problems in macroeconomics, labor, development, and industrial organization that could be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.},

	abstract = {Chapter 1 of this dissertation seeks to understand the sources and nature of measurement errors in temperature variables, and how they can influence climate impact estimations. Measurement error in temperature variables is usually assumed to be “classical'' i.i.d. normal and “small''. This type of measurement error leads to attenuation bias, that is often small enough to be ignored. We show, however, that measurement errors in temperature variables are often large, distinctly non-normal, and vary systematically across space and time. The divergence between our empirical results and conventional wisdom stems from the fact that the construction of the temperature variables involves a series of steps, each of which introduces a distinct source of measurement error. This work is the first to formally characterize sources of measurement error in temperature variables and how they interact. Simulation results are provided that illustrate the influence of these sources of measurement errors on climate impact estimates. We further propose a correction method that can be used to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest under the conditions identified. In Chapter 2, I zoom in to examine one particular source of measurement error: measurement error induced by using coarse data to approximate daily mean temperature. Much of the historical records from weather stations around the world reports on minimum and maximum temperature and this practice is still followed by most stations. The minimum and maximum are averaged to approximate daily mean temperature, the exposure variable most commonly used in climate impact studies. Empirically, I find substantive differences between daily mean temperatures constructed using hourly temperature data and daily minimum and maximum temperature. This single source of measurement error can easily result in a 5 to 10{\textbackslash}\% bias in estimates of the impact of daily mean temperature on an output measure of economic interest, with the direction of the bias dependent on the location and season of the year.Chapter 3 investigates climate impact models from another perspective: the representation of climate variables. The “bin” regression model has been put forward as a flexible semi-parametric method for representing a climate variable and it has emerged as the workhorse approach for empirical work (e.g., Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011). Our work is the first to formally explore econometric properties of the bin regression approach. We show that, although the bin regression approach often produces reasonable results, that the approach produces consistent parameter estimates only under very stringent and highly unlikely assumptions about the true data generating procedure. Problems with the bin regression approach are likely to be most severe in the tail bin categories, where most policy interest with respect to climate change impacts lies. We propose alternatives to bin model for the climate change impacts that produce consistent estimates and generally have better efficiency properties.},

	abstract = {Identification in econometric models maps prior assumptions and the data to information about a parameter of interest. The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complications, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct confidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.},

Autocorrelated errors of a general form or following an AR(1), MA(1), or ARMA(1,1) form are allowable. This model can also be used for analysis of clustered data, where the mixed-effects model assumes data within clusters are dependent. The degree of dependency is estimated jointly with estimates of the usual model parameters, thus adjusting for clustering. MIXREG uses maximum marginal likelihood estimation, utilizing both the EM algorithm and a Fisher-scoring solution.

Some medical students perform less well in the clinical years than would be expected from their pre-clinical performances. One factor is some students' difficulty in adapting to the culture of medicine, which mentors can help students overcome. The University of Rochester School of Medicine created the Medical Student Mentoring Program to address the needs of URM students and non-URM faculty who could be mentors. The program, offered in 1995-96 and 1996-97, trained mentors, created a bicultural support group for URM students, and provided structured mentoring. Interviews were conducted with faculty and students to identify critical areas that influence the success of URM students in their clinical years; URM faculty, residents, and advanced students shared their experiences with the program students at reflection group meetings. Mentors participated in an initial orientation. Of the 42 students eligible during 1995-1997, 30 participated and were assigned to 15 mentors. At the end of the program's first year, the students and mentors gave their reactions, and although there were some differences in their viewpoints, overall they considered the program useful. Non-URM faculty appreciated the support and guidance that allowed them to mentor URM students more effectively. The program ran formally for two years, and some of the mentoring relationships continued into the third year. Loss of funding and change in administrative leadership contributed to the ending of this program. Mentoring continues to be a priority at the medical center, and a new mentoring program has been developed for URM and non-URM medical students.},

A fifth factor was implicit in the conversations: peer effects.},

The method reduces the computational burden of estimating such models. We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators. To illustrate our new method, we estimate a dynamic model of parental contraceptive choice and fertility using data from the National Fertility Survey.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations and real-world panel data, we demonstrate that failing to account for arbitrary serial correlation ex ante yields experiments that are incorrectly powered under proper inference. By contrast, our “serial-correlation-robust” power calculations achieve correctly powered experiments in both simulated and real data. We discuss the implications of these results, and introduce a new software package to facilitate proper power calculations in practice.},

Almost all are well defined, but how to determine before the fact which one, if any, will partition a given set of objects in an “insightful” or “useful” way for a given user is unknown and difficult, if not logically impossible. We develop a metric space of partitions from all existing cluster analysis methods applied to a given dataset (along with millions of other solutions we add based on combinations of existing clusterings) and enable a user to explore and interact with it and quickly reveal or prompt useful or insightful conceptualizations. In addition, although it is uncommon to do so in unsupervised learning problems, we offer and implement evaluation designs that make our computer-assisted approach vulnerable to being proven suboptimal in specific data types. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates more efficient and insightful discovery of useful information than expert human coders or many existing fully automated methods.},

Spillovers in CFL adoption further reduce electricity consumption, contributing to increased reliability within a transformer. CFLs' impacts on household electricity consumption vary according to the effects on reliability. Receiving CFLs significantly reduces electricity consumption, but increased reliability permits greater consumption of electricity services.},

	abstract = {A growing number of policies and programs aim to increase investment in energy eﬃciency, because conventional wisdom suggests that people fail to take-up these investments even though they have positive private returns and generate environmental beneﬁts. Many explanations for this energy eﬃciency gap have been put forward but there has been surprisingly little ﬁeld testing of whether the conventional wisdom is correct. This paper reports on the results of an experimental evaluation of the nation’s largest residential energy eﬃciency program – the Weatherization Assistance Program – conducted on a sample of approximately 30,000 households in Michigan. The ﬁndings suggest that the upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. Further, the model-projected savings are more than three times the actual savings. While this might be attributed to the “rebound” eﬀect – when demand for energy end uses increases as a result of greater eﬃciency – the paper fails to ﬁnd evidence of signiﬁcantly higher indoor temperatures at weatherized homes. Even when accounting for the broader societal beneﬁts derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the beneﬁts; the average rate of return is approximately -7.8\% annually.},

With the rapid development in deep learning, it has drawn attention of several researchers with innovations in approaches to join a race. These innovations proposed comprise region proposals, divided grid cell, multiscale feature maps, and new loss function. As a result, performance of object detection has recently had significant improvements. However, most of the state-of-the-art detectors, both in one-stage and two-stage approaches, have struggled with detecting small objects. In this study, we evaluate current state-of-the-art models based on deep learning in both approaches such as Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv3. We provide a profound assessment of the advantages and limitations of models. Specifically, we run models with different backbones on different datasets with multiscale objects to find out what types of objects are suitable for each model along with backbones. Extensive empirical evaluation was conducted on 2 standard datasets, namely, a small object dataset and a filtered dataset from PASCAL VOC 2007.

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the way in which the operation of the medical-care industry and the efficacy with which it satisfies the needs of society differ from a norm. The term norm that the economist usually uses for the purposes of such comparisons is the operation of a competitive model, that is, the flows of services that would be offered and purchased and the prices that would be paid for them. The interest in the competitive model stems partly from its presumed descriptive power and partly from its implications for economic efficiency. If a competitive equilibrium exists at all and if all commodities relevant to costs or utilities are in fact priced in the market, then the equilibrium is necessarily optimal. There is no other allocation of resources to services that will make all participants in the market better off. The most obvious distinguishing characteristics of an individual's demand for medical services is that it is not steady in origin as, for example, for food or clothing but is irregular and unpredictable. Medical services, apart from preventive services, afford satisfaction only in the event of illness, a departure from the normal state of affairs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Despite a history of problems, nuclear power is being discussed as a potentially useful and appropriate electricity source for both developed and developing countries. For example, expanding nuclear power's share of electricity portfolios could reduce, relative to a fossil-intensive baseline, greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. Moreover, nuclear power has long been advocated as a route to energy security and indeed, for many of the nuclear nations, it could decrease dependence on oil imports under certain technological scenarios, such as an increased use of plug-in hybrid vehicles. The nuclear industry argues that a new generation of reactors, representing a refinement of existing technology, will enable this expansion. Because of these new motivations, some advocates have applied the term ?nuclear renaissance? to the possibility of a rapid expansion of nuclear power to satisfy a projected growing global electricity demand, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This article outlines the primary challenges that this unique energy source presents for such a renaissance. Like other technologies, nuclear is situated in a social and political?economic matrix that influences its evolution. After reviewing the basic aspects of the technology, I discuss the history of the existing nuclear fleet, then address the prospects for advanced and next-generation nuclear technologies. I review the economics of nuclear power as it is currently deployed and the potential changes to these economics under potential future development. In examining future scenarios, I explore the effects of national and international policies on nuclear energy.

The author analyses links between Chinese and Namibian actors in three domains: ‘soft power’, Chinese traders and the construction industry. In all three, the presence of Chinese actors does not simply change Namibia’s relations with the world. It has important repercussions on Namibian society, it influences the distribution of capital within Namibia and it engenders shifts in the internal balance of power. Since Chinese influence does not remain external, the line between ‘Chinese’ and ‘Namibian’ actors has long become blurred – turning Namibian political elites into constituent parts of the ‘external’ dynamics they are charged with regulating.},

Husab's materialisation of ?South?South solidarity,? however, also appears to be deepening the marginalisation of minority communities near uranium mines. Far from paradoxical, this uneven distribution of benefits and costs is as intertwined with nuclear geopolitics as it is with the materiality of uranium mining.},

	abstract = {A key challenge for engineers and scientists over the coming decades is to develop and deploy power plants with sufficient capacity and flexibility to meet the growing demand for energy (mainly electrical) whilst simultaneously reducing emissions (primarily greenhouse gases). With fusion-based power plants not currently being considered viable for large-scale deployment for at least 40 years, other technologies must to be considered. Renewable and high efficiency combined gas-fired plants, along with nuclear solutions, are regarded as the most suitable candidates, with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) developing as a favoured choice. However, two main impediments to the current deployment of SMRs exist: (1) safety concerns, particularly following the Fukushima accident, and (2) their economic models, with high capital costs only being available through a limited number of investors. The goal of this paper is to provide a review and a holistic assessment of this class of nuclear reactor, with specific focus on the most common technology: the Light Water Reactor (LWR). In particular, the paper provides a state-of-the-art assessment of their life cycle, along with a comparison of their relative merits with other base-load technologies. It is shown that SMRs are a suitable choice when the power to be installed is in the range 1–3GWe and the social aspects of the investment, such as the creation of new employment positions, is a goal of policy makers. The paper thereby provides governments and stakeholders with key economic and social boundaries for the viable deployment of SMRs.},

Through analysis of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste site in the USA, I show how the lack of discussion of values occludes participation by marginalized American Indians. In particular, I examine the incommensurability between American Indian nations that value Yucca Mountain as sacred land and the federal government that values Yucca Mountain as a national sacrifice zone. I argue that Yucca Mountain acts as a polysemous value term in the controversy. My findings suggest that an environmentally just model of participation in environmental decision making must include a way to account for incommensurable values and cultural differences. Further, I highlight the lessons we can learn from the Yucca Mountain project as we deliberate about what to do with nuclear waste.},

The challenge for cryptocurrencies is to overcome double-spending by relying on competition to update the blockchain (costly mining) and by delaying settlement. We estimate that the current Bitcoin scheme generates a large welfare loss of 1.4\% of consumption. This welfare loss can be lowered substantially to 0.08\% by adopting an optimal design that reduces mining and relies exclusively on money growth rather than transaction fees to finance mining rewards. We also point out that cryptocurrencies can potentially challenge retail payment systems provided scaling limitations can be addressed.},

Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers.

Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure—or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment—though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems.

BACKGROUNDFor centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research has begun to illuminate key linkages in the coupling of these complex natural and human systems, uncovering notable effects of climate on health, agriculture, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics.
ADVANCESPast scholars of climate-society interactions were limited to theorizing on the basis of anecdotal evidence; advances in computing, data availability, and study design now allow researchers to draw generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events to social outcomes. This endeavor has demonstrated that a range of climate factors have substantial influence on societies and economies, both past and present, with important implications for the future.Temperature, in particular, exerts remarkable influence over human systems at many social scales; heat induces mortality, has lasting impact on fetuses and infants, and incites aggression and violence while lowering human productivity. High temperatures also damage crops, inflate electricity demand, and may trigger population movements within and across national borders. Tropical cyclones cause mortality, damage assets, and reduce economic output for long periods. Precipitation extremes harm economies and populations predominately in agriculturally dependent settings. These effects are often quantitatively substantial; for example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields roughly 48\%, warming trends since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by 11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by 0.28 percentage points year−1. Much research aims to forecast impacts of future climate change, but we point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected end-of-century impacts of climate change. For instance, we calculate that current temperature climatologies slow global economic growth roughly 0.25 percentage points year−1, comparable to the additional slowing of 0.28 percentage points year−1 projected from future warming.Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climate—why this has not already occurred everywhere remains a critical open question. For example, clear patterns of adaptation in health impacts and in response to tropical cyclones contrast strongly with limited adaptation in agricultural and macroeconomic responses to temperature. Although some theories suggest these various levels of adaptation ought to be economically optimal, in the sense that costs of additional adaptive actions should exactly balance the benefits of avoided climate-related losses, there is no evidence that allows us to determine how closely observed “adaptation gaps” reflect optimal investments or constrained suboptimal adaptation that should be addressed through policy.
OUTLOOKRecent findings provide insight into the historical evolution of the global economy; they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we understand the consequences of future climate changes. Although climate is clearly not the only factor that affects social and economic outcomes, new quantitative measurements reveal that it is a major factor, often with first-order consequences. Research over the coming decade will seek to understand the numerous mechanisms that drive these effects, with the hope that policy may interfere with the most damaging pathways of influence. Both current and future generations will benefit from near-term investigations. “Cracking the code” on when, where, and why adaptation is or is not successful will generate major social benefits today and in the future. In addition, calculations used to design global climate change policies require as input “damage functions” that describe how social and economic losses accrue under different climatic conditions, essential elements that now can (and should) be calibrated to real-world relationships. Designing effective, efficient, and fair policies to manage anthropogenic climate change requires that we possess a quantitative grasp of how different investments today may affect economic and social possibilities in the future. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/353/6304/aad9837/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Two globes depict two possible futures for how the climate might change and how those changes are likely to affect humanity, based on recent empirical findings.Base colors are temperature change under “Business as usual” (left, RCP 8.5) and “stringent emissions mitigation” (right, RCP 2.6). Overlaid are composite satellite images of nighttime lights with rescaled intensity reflecting changes in economic productivity in each climate scenario.
For centuries, thinkers have considered whether and how climatic conditions—such as temperature, rainfall, and violent storms—influence the nature of societies and the performance of economies. A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by {\textasciitilde}48\%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by {\textasciitilde}11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by {\textasciitilde}0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.},

	abstract = {Farm subsidies have become increasingly maligned in agricultural policy debates, but the merits of subsidies are a distraction from deeper political, economic, and ecological problems in agriculture. Drawing on a history of the U.S. Farm Bill, this paper argues that a fixation on farm subsidies ignores why they came into being, and more generally glosses over the imperative for modern states to intervene into agricultural economies. Karl Polanyi's 'double movement' framework is used to situate the rise and fall of agricultural supply management within food regime theory. In the second, or surplus food regime, the U.S. government wielded excess commodities as geopolitical tools—even as domestic farm policy labored to contain overproduction, and thus support agrarian viability. In the subsequent corporate food regime, “free market” agriculture displaces and discredits supply management, even as massive government intervention into how food is grown and sold continues. Making space to remember historical price support programs, to situate their accomplishments and limitations, and to recognize residual supply-management mechanisms (such as farm cooperatives and agricultural marketing orders) is crucial for fostering agricultural viability in the US and beyond. Twentieth century supply management had flaws, but it cannot be wholly omitted. This paper highlights key motivations, elements, and contradictions of these policies and programs to begin the process of considering how supply management principles and strategies could be updated and enhanced for 21st century agriculture. Such a framework would need to pay more attention to diversity within domestic and international agricultures, and be more sensitive to the multi-scalar dimensions of food systems.},

While Americans are accustomed to US Congress revisiting the farm bill every five to seven years, less familiar is the breadth of influence agricultural policy has in today's society. For example, as 2012 waned without a new farm bill, surprised consumers learned milk prices could nearly double if agricultural supply management programs reverted to default policies established in 1949 (Editorial Board 2012). Furthermore, nutrition programs received over two-thirds of the US\$400+ billion allocated by the 2008 farm bill (figure 1), indicating that agricultural policy extends well beyond the farm. Farm bills are particularly relevant to soil and water conservation, as their conservation programs have become the dominant source of public funds for private lands conservation (Burger et al. 2006). The number and complexity of farm bills, however, make it difficult to comprehend the scope and impact of this legislation.
Here we provide a historical primer on US agricultural policy as a foundation for understanding current food, energy, and environmental policy discussions. This retrospective marks the 80th anniversary of the first comprehensive farm bill—the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 (table 1).

Changes in the structure of agriculture have changed the distribution of income support over time. Specifically, commodity program payments, some conservation program payments, and Federal crop insurance indemnities have shifted to larger farms as U.S. agricultural production continues to consolidate. Since the operators of larger farms have higher household incomes than those of smaller farms, commodity program payments and support through Federal crop insurance have also shifted to higher income households.

However, farmland appreciation has slowed considerably over the last 2 years due to lower commodity prices and lower net cash farm income, raising questions about the potential impact on farm financial stress. This study finds that farmland appreciation lowered the share of farms that were considered financially stressed in 2000-2012, particularly those that owned less than one-quarter of their acres operated. It also finds that farms that owned at least 50 percent of their acres purchased more farmland during periods of high appreciation and land equity gains.

Capitalization in the years preceding and following the "decoupling" of agricultural support payments from agricultural production is explored. In the period prior to decoupling, direct support (Pillar 1) payments were highly capitalized into Irish agricultural rents (67–90 cents per euro of subsidies), while in the post-decoupling period capitalization appears to have declined somewhat.},

Countries have implemented agricultural subsidy policies with a focus on food security and environmental protection. Agricultural production is risky and uncertain, influencing the efficiency of agricultural subsidies. This study develops a theoretical framework to analyze the effects of production uncertainties on the efficiency of agricultural subsidy policies under the double constraints of food security and environmental protection. The basic model is investigated under six different conditions, and expanded research also is presented. Our models show that uncertainty, including output, cost, and price uncertainties, and technology conversion efficiency significantly affects the efficiency of agricultural subsidies. Under high technology conversion efficiency, output-oriented subsidies are appropriate for food security and environmental protection goals. Policymakers should take both uncertainty and production efficiency into consideration when choosing between input-oriented and output-oriented subsidy policies.},

We answer this question using a data set that identiﬁes Ontario farmers’ conservation practices on their own land as well as the land they rent. Using a ﬁxed-effects regression approach, we ﬁnd that the role of tenure varies for different types of conservation practices. Farmers were found to be just as likely to adopt a machinery-related practice such as conservation tillage on their rented land as that land which they own. On the other hand, farmers were found to be less likely to adopt site-speciﬁc conservation practices such as planting cover crops on rented land. However, this effect diminishes as the expected length of the rental relationship increases when the landlord has a farming background.},

	abstract = {If agricultural subsidies are largely capitalized into farmland values through their effect on rental rates, then expanding support for agriculture may not beneﬁt farmers who rent the land they farm. Existing evidence on the incidence of subsidies on cash rental rates is mixed. Identiﬁcation is obscured by unobserved or imprecisely measured factors that tend to be correlated with subsidies, especially land quality and time-varying factors like commodity prices and adverse weather events. A problem that has received less attention is the fact that subsidies and land quality on rented land may differ from owned land. Since most farms possess both rented and owned acreage, farm-level measures of subsidies, land values, and rental rates may bias estimated incidence. Using a new, ﬁeld-level data set that, for the ﬁrst time, precisely links subsidies to land parcels, we show that this bias is considerable: where farm-level estimates suggest an incidence of 42–49 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar, ﬁeld-level estimates from the same farms indicate that landlords capture just 20–28 cents. The size of the farm and the duration of the rental arrangement have substantial effects. Incidence falls by 5–15 cents when doubling total operated acres, and the incidence falls by 0.1–0.8 cents with each additional year of the rental arrangement. Low incidence of subsidies on rents combined with the farm-size and duration effects suggest that farmers renting land have monopsony power.},

	abstract = {Many economists have argued that all farm subsidies are ultimately capitalized in land values. This chapter shows, both theoretically and empirically, that this is not so, although there is much room for disagreement as to the precise shares that accrue to landowners, farmers, and consumers. A review of econometric models in the literature, multimarket simulations, and the application of a sector model of US agriculture yields a range of results about the share of subsidy payments going to land. The truth probably lies in between the results from the static theoretical models with full adjustment and the general run of the econometric evidence. A signiﬁcant share of even the so-called decoupled transfers goes to farmers rather than landowners, and both landowners and farm operators receive a signiﬁcant share of the net beneﬁts from subsidies. In an in-between case, based on 2005 market and policy conditions, for every dollar of government spending on farm subsidies, farmers receive about 50 cents, landlords receive about 25 cents, domestic and foreign consumers receive about 20 cents, and 5 cents is wasted. Additional amounts are wasted collecting the taxes to ﬁnance the spending and in administering the policies – perhaps another 20 cents.},

An important question is how much of that resulted from government restrictions on activity versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the collapse using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior within the same commuting zones but across boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the decline of economic activity (and that having county-level policy data is significantly more accurate than state-level data). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 of that. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly tied to the number of COVID deaths in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from larger/busier stores toward smaller/less busy ones in the same industry. States repealing their shutdown orders saw identically modest recoveries–symmetric going down and coming back. The shutdown orders did, however, have significantly reallocate consumer activity away from “nonessential” to “essential” businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers.},

Our results show that, without UK government aid, 59\% of UK SMEs will report negative earnings and that the residual life of firms with negative earnings will be reduced from 164 days to 139 days as a direct consequence of the pandemic. Government intervention decreases the number of SMEs with negative earnings to 49\% and allows to extend the residual life for SMEs with negative earnings between 183 and 194 days. In addition, the policy reduces the jobs at risk by around 20\%. However, our results suggest that weaker firms seem to benefit more from the schemes than strong ones and that the areas as well as the industries that are worst hit by COVID-19 are not those that benefit at most from the government intervention. We ascribe this result to the fact that policies are very general and do not discriminate between those firms that deserve support and those that do not deserve it.},

The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22 percent over the crucial two-month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African-American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41 percent drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32 percent, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26 percent. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36 percent. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25 percent drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low – down by 15 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries. These findings of early-stage losses to small business activity have important implications for policy, income losses, and future economic inequality.},

	abstract = {In addition to its impact on public health, COVID-19 has had a major impact on the economy. To shed light on how COVID-19 is affecting small businesses – and on the likely impact of the recent stimulus bill, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses. Several main themes emerge from the results. First, mass layoffs and closures have already occurred. In our sample, 43 percent of businesses are temporarily closed, and businesses have – on average – reduced their employee counts by 40 percent relative to January. Second, consistent with previous literature, we find that many small businesses are financially fragile. For example, the median business has more than \$10,000 in monthly expenses and less than one month of cash on hand. Third, businesses have widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of COVID related disruptions. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the CARES act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the aid, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility.},

	abstract = {Using convenient stratification criteria such as geographical regions or other natural conditions like age, gender, etc., is not beneficial in order to maximize the precision of the estimates of variables of interest. Thus, one has to look for an efficient stratification design to divide the whole population into homogeneous strata that achieves higher precision in the estimation. In this paper, a procedure for determining Optimum Stratum Boundaries (OSB) and Optimum Sample Sizes (OSS) for each stratum of a variable of interest in health surveys is developed. The determination of OSB and OSS based on the study variable is not feasible in practice since the study variable is not available prior to the survey. Since many variables in health surveys are generally skewed, the proposed technique considers the readily-available auxiliary variables to determine the OSB and OSS. This stratification problem is formulated into a Mathematical Programming Problem (MPP) that seeks minimization of the variance of the estimated population parameter under Neyman allocation. It is then solved for the OSB by using a dynamic programming (DP) technique. A numerical example with a real data set of a population, aiming to estimate the Haemoglobin content in women in a national Iron Deficiency Anaemia survey, is presented to illustrate the procedure developed in this paper. Upon comparisons with other methods available in literature, results reveal that the proposed approach yields a substantial gain in efficiency over the other methods. A simulation study also reveals similar results.},

This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970’s, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods–or developing methods related to matching–do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

We argue that diminishing returns to foraging by bees is a central constraint of the economic problem of beekeeping and that availability of forage plays an important role in determining the abundance of honey bees. Furthermore, we show how the behaviors of individual beekeepers are aggregated through markets for bees and characterize the response of the beekeeping industry to changes in honey prices, winter losses, and other factors. Our model sets the bases for an empirical approach to estimate the relative contributions of different biological and economic factors to changes in honey bee populations in the United States over the past 60 years.},

This paper takes beekeeping, a fundamental if often overlooked aspect of contemporary agrifood production, as its subject. Beekeeping is examined through a combination of more-than-human studies and social practice theory, literatures with which agrifood scholars have yet to widely engage. The paper outlines connections and tensions between these fields, to develop a vital approach to more-than-human practice. The potential of such an approach is illustrated through ethnographic investigation of commercial beekeeping in Australia. Beekeeping is followed through three constituent activities: setting fruit; shifting hives; and, chasing honey. This exploration reveals shifting agency among practitioners, frictions among considerations of the practice and its practitioners, and new dis/connections among commodities, agendas, and places. This approach to contemporary beekeeping indicates other possible points of intervention important to future practice, with wider implications for agrifood production and research.},

The typical models used to analyze observational data (e.g., least squares regressions, difference of difference methods) involve outcomes, and so cannot be used for design in this sense. Because the propensity score is a function only of covariates, not outcomes, repeated analyses attempting to balance covariate distributions across treatment groups do not bias estimates of the treatment effect on outcome variables. This theme will the primary focus of this article: how to use the techniques of matching, subclassification and/or weighting to help design observational studies. The article also proposes a new diagnostic table to aid in this endeavor, which is especially useful when there are many covariates under consideration. The conclusion of the initial design phase may be that the treatment and control groups are too far apart to produce reliable effect estimates without heroic modeling assumptions. In such cases, it may be wisest to abandon the intended observational study, and search for a more acceptable data set where such heroic modeling assumptions are not necessary. The ideas and techniques will be illustrated using the initial design of an observational study for use in the tobacco litigation based on the NMES data set.},

	abstract = {Objective
Examining covariate balance is the prescribed method for determining the degree to which propensity score methods should be successful at reducing bias. This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (similar to a disease risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate.
Study Design and Setting
The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only.
Results
The absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD) in prognostic scores, the mean ASMD (in covariates), and the mean t-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations with bias of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification, and the prognostic score measure performed well under a variety of scenarios.
Conclusion
Researchers should consider using prognostic score–based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in nonexperimental studies.},

	abstract = {In this paper we explore strategic decision making in new technology adoption by using economic analysis. We show how asymmetric information affects firms' decisions to adopt the technology. We do so in a two-stage game-theoretic model where the first-stage investment results in the acquisition of a new technology that, in the second stage, may give the firm a competitive advantage in the product market. We compare two information structures under which two competing firms have asymmetric information about the future performance (i.e., postadoption costs) of the new technology. We find that equilibrium strategies under asymmetric information are quite different from those under symmetric information. Information asymmetry leads to different incentives and strategic behaviors in the technology adoption game. In contrast to conventional wisdom, our model shows that market uncertainty may actually induce firms to act more aggressively under certain conditions. We also show that having better information is not always a good thing. These results illustrate a key departure from established decision theory.},

Renewable/sustainable energy technologies have faced a number of constraints that have affected their rate of adoption. In this paper an attempt has been made to identify and rank the major barriers in the adoption of ‘renewable and green’ energy technologies in the Indian context. Twenty-eight barriers have been identified from an extensive literature review. These identified barriers have been categorized into seven dimensions of barriers, i.e. Economical \& Financial; Market; Awareness \& Information; Technical; Ecological and Geographical; Cultural \& Behavioral; and Political \& Government Issues. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique has been utilized for ranking of barriers to adopt renewable/sustainable technologies in the Indian context. All pair comparisons in AHP have been made based on experts’ opinions (selected from academia and industry). Sensitivity analysis has also been made to investigate the priority ranking stability of barriers to adopt renewable/sustainable technologies in the Indian context. This paper may help practitioners, regulators and academician focus their future efforts in adoption of ‘renewable/sustainable energy technologies’ in India. Further, this understanding may be helpful in framing the policies and strategies towards adoption of renewable/sustainable energy technologies.},

To aid this decision-making process, we have developed a generic optimization-based model for the long-range energy planning and design of future hydrogen supply systems. By applying Linear Dynamic Programming techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply system configurations from the many alternatives.

In this study, we considered a hydrogen production mix of five technologies: natural gas reforming processes with or without carbon capture and storage, electrolysis, biogas processes and on-site production. We estimate two external costs: the abatement cost of CO2 through FCV and the use of non-renewable resources in the manufacture of fuel cells by measuring platinum depletion. We forecast that carbon market could finance approximately 10\% of the deployment cost of hydrogen-based transport and that an early economic conversion could be targeted for FCV.

	abstract = {An impact with a dash of volcanism
Around the time of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction that wiped out dinosaurs, there was both a bolide impact and a large amount of volcanism. Hull et al. ran several temperature simulations based on different volcanic outgassing scenarios and compared them with temperature records across the extinction event. The best model fits to the data required most outgassing to occur before the impact. When combined with other lines of evidence, these models support an impact-driven extinction. However, volcanic gases may have played a role in shaping the rise of different species after the extinction event.
Science, this issue p. 266
The cause of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction is vigorously debated, owing to the occurrence of a very large bolide impact and flood basalt volcanism near the boundary. Disentangling their relative importance is complicated by uncertainty regarding kill mechanisms and the relative timing of volcanogenic outgassing, impact, and extinction. We used carbon cycle modeling and paleotemperature records to constrain the timing of volcanogenic outgassing. We found support for major outgassing beginning and ending distinctly before the impact, with only the impact coinciding with mass extinction and biologically amplified carbon cycle change. Our models show that these extinction-related carbon cycle changes would have allowed the ocean to absorb massive amounts of carbon dioxide, thus limiting the global warming otherwise expected from postextinction volcanism.
The primary cause of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction was an impact, with volcanism playing a role in the aftermath.

	abstract = {Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies continue to experience high annual losses that remain poorly explained. Numerous interacting factors have been linked to colony declines. Understanding the pathways linking pathophysiology with symptoms is an important step in understanding the mechanisms of disease. In this study we examined the specific pathologies associated with honey bees collected from colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and compared these with bees collected from apparently healthy colonies. We identified a set of pathological physical characteristics that occurred at different rates in CCD diagnosed colonies prior to their collapse: rectum distension, Malpighian tubule iridescence, fecal matter consistency, rectal enteroliths (hard concretions), and venom sac color. The multiple differences in rectum symptomology in bees from CCD apiaries and colonies suggest effected bees had trouble regulating water. To ensure that pathologies we found associated with CCD were indeed pathologies and not due to normal changes in physical appearances that occur as an adult bee ages (CCD colonies are assumed to be composed mostly of young bees), we documented the changes in bees of different ages taken from healthy colonies. We found that young bees had much greater incidences of white nodules than older cohorts. Prevalent in newly-emerged bees, these white nodules or cellular encapsulations indicate an active immune response. Comparing the two sets of characteristics, we determined a subset of pathologies that reliably predict CCD status rather than bee age (fecal matter consistency, rectal distension size, rectal enteroliths and Malpighian tubule iridescence) and that may serve as biomarkers for colony health. In addition, these pathologies suggest that CCD bees are experiencing disrupted excretory physiology. Our identification of these symptoms is an important first step in understanding the physiological pathways that underlie CCD and factors impacting bee health.},

	title = {In situ replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder},
	abstract = {The concern of persistent loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies worldwide since 2006, a phenomenon referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), has led us to investigate the role of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in the emergence of CCD. CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidaclopridtreated hives (94\%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.},

For this reason, it is alarming that honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations across the world have recently seen increased rates of mortality.

However, the effect of climate on colony mortality has never been demonstrated. Therefore, in this study, we focus on longer-term weather conditions and/or climate's influence on honey bee winter mortality rates across Austria. Statistical correlations between monthly climate variables and winter mortality rates were investigated. Our results indicate that warmer and drier weather conditions in the preceding year were accompanied by increased winter mortality. We subsequently built a statistical model to predict colony mortality using temperature and precipitation data as predictors. Our model reduces the mean absolute error between predicted and observed colony mortalities by 9\% and is statistically significant at the 99.9\% confidence level. This is the first study to show clear evidence of a link between climate variability and honey bee winter mortality.},

	abstract = {Honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens mate with unusually high numbers of males (average of approximately 12 drones), although there is much variation among queens. One main consequence of such extreme polyandry is an increased diversity of worker genotypes within a colony, which has been shown empirically to confer significant adaptive advantages that result in higher colony productivity and survival. Moreover, honey bees are the primary insect pollinators used in modern commercial production agriculture, and their populations have been in decline worldwide. Here, we compare the mating frequencies of queens, and therefore, intracolony genetic diversity, in three commercial beekeeping operations to determine how they correlate with various measures of colony health and productivity, particularly the likelihood of queen supersedure and colony survival in functional, intensively managed beehives. We found the average effective paternity frequency (m e ) of this population of honey bee queens to be 13.6 ± 6.76, which was not significantly different between colonies that superseded their queen and those that did not. However, colonies that were less genetically diverse (headed by queens with m e ≤ 7.0) were 2.86 times more likely to die by the end of the study when compared to colonies that were more genetically diverse (headed by queens with m e {\textgreater} 7.0). The stark contrast in colony survival based on increased genetic diversity suggests that there are important tangible benefits of increased queen mating number in managed honey bees, although the exact mechanism(s) that govern these benefits have not been fully elucidated.},

Here, we established a standardised active monitoring network for 5 798 apiaries over two consecutive years to quantify honey bee colony mortality across 17 European countries. Our data demonstrate that overwinter losses ranged between 2\% and 32\%, and that high summer losses were likely to follow high winter losses. Multivariate Poisson regression models revealed that hobbyist beekeepers with small apiaries and little experience in beekeeping had double the winter mortality rate when compared to professional beekeepers. Furthermore, honey bees kept by professional beekeepers never showed signs of disease, unlike apiaries from hobbyist beekeepers that had symptoms of bacterial infection and heavy Varroa infestation. Our data highlight beekeeper background and apicultural practices as major drivers of honey bee colony losses. The benefits of conducting trans-national monitoring schemes and improving beekeeper training are discussed.},

After 4 months of monitoring, a whole-model analysis showed that apiaries in which colonies were spaced 100 m apart contained lower average mite numbers than 0 or 10 m apiaries. There were interactions among colony type, distance, and sampling date; however, when there were significant differences, mite numbers were always lower in 100 m apiaries than 10 m apiaries.

I provide further support for this hypothesis by showing that states with the largest areas of open land have a significantly higher honey yield on a per colony basis.

	abstract = {The honey bee parasite Varroa destructor Anderson \& Trueman can disperse and invade honey bee colonies by attaching to “drifting” and “robbing” honey bees that move into nonnatal colonies. We quantiÞed the weekly invasion rates and the subsequent mite population growth from the end of July to November 2011 in 28 honey bee colonies kept in two apiaries that had high (HBD) and low (LBD) densities of neighboring colonies. At each apiary, half (seven) of the colonies were continuously treated with acaricides to kill all Varroa mites and thereby determine the invasion rates. The other group of colonies was only treated before the beginning of the experiment and then left untreated to record Varroa population growth until a Þnal treatment in November. The numbers of bees and brood cells of all colonies were estimated according to the Liebefeld evaluation method. The invasion rates varied among individual colonies but revealed highly signiÞcant differences between the study sites. The average invasion rate per colony over the entire 3.5-mo period ranged from 266 to 1,171 mites at the HBD site compared with only 72 to 248 mites at the LBD apiary. In the untreated colonies, the Varroa population reached an average Þnal infestation in November of 2,082 mites per colony (HBD) and 340 mites per colony (LBD). All colonies survived the winter; however, the higher infested colonies lost about three times more bees compared with the lower infested colonies. Therefore, mite invasion and late-year population growth must be considered more carefully for future treatment concepts in temperate regions.},

The evidence is equivocal and puzzling: for instance, many pathogens and parasites can be found in both failing and surviving colonies and field pesticide exposure is typically sublethal. Here, we investigate how these results can be due to sublethal stress impairing colony function. We mathematically modelled stress on individual bees which impairs colony function and found how positive density dependence can cause multiple dynamic outcomes: some colonies fail while others thrive. We then exposed bumblebee colonies to sublethal levels of a neonicotinoid pesticide. The dynamics of colony failure, which we observed, were most accurately described by our model. We argue that our model can explain the enigmatic aspects of bee colony failures, highlighting an important role for sublethal stress in colony declines.},

	abstract = {Background Chemical analysis shows that honey bees (Apis mellifera) and hive products contain many pesticides derived from various sources. The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply antimicrobial drugs to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive when applied to nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, antimicrobial drugs and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, as well as between acaricides and antimicrobial drugs and between acaricides and fungicides. Toxicity of the acaricide tau-fluvalinate increased in combination with other acaricides and most other compounds tested (15 of 17) while amitraz toxicity was mostly unchanged (1 of 15). The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicide prochloraz elevated the toxicity of the acaricides tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos and fenpyroximate, likely through inhibition of detoxicative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity. Four other SBI fungicides increased the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate in a dose-dependent manner, although possible evidence of P450 induction was observed at the lowest fungicide doses. Non-transitive interactions between some acaricides were observed. Sublethal amitraz pre-treatment increased the toxicity of the three P450-detoxified acaricides, but amitraz toxicity was not changed by sublethal treatment with the same three acaricides. A two-fold change in the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate was observed between years, suggesting a possible change in the genetic composition of the bees tested. Conclusions/Significance Interactions with acaricides in honey bees are similar to drug interactions in other animals in that P450-mediated detoxication appears to play an important role. Evidence of non-transivity, year-to-year variation and induction of detoxication enzymes indicates that pesticide interactions in bees may be as complex as drug interactions in mammals.},

	abstract = {The ectoparasitic honey bee mite Varroa destructor was originally confined to the Eastern honey bee Apis cerana. After a shift to the new host Apis mellifera during the first half of the last century, the parasite dispersed world wide and is currently considered the major threat for apiculture. The damage caused by Varroosis is thought to be a crucial driver for the periodical colony losses in Europe and the USA and regular Varroa treatments are essential in these countries. Therefore, Varroa research not only deals with a fascinating host–parasite relationship but also has a responsibility to find sustainable solutions for the beekeeping. This review provides a survey of the current knowledge in the main fields of Varroa research including the biology of the mite, damage to the host, host tolerance, tolerance breeding and Varroa treatment. We first present a general view on the functional morphology and on the biology of the Varroa mite with special emphasis on host–parasite interactions during reproduction of the female mite. The pathology section describes host damage at the individual and colony level including the problem of transmission of secondary infections by the mite. Knowledge of both the biology and the pathology of Varroa mites is essential for understanding possible tolerance mechanisms in the honey bee host. We comment on the few examples of natural tolerance in A. mellifera and evaluate recent approaches to the selection of Varroa tolerant honey bees. Finally, an extensive listing and critical evaluation of chemical and biological methods of Varroa treatments is given. This compilation of present-day knowledge on Varroa honey bee interactions emphasizes that we are still far from a solution for Varroa infestation and that, therefore, further research on mite biology, tolerance breeding, and Varroa treatment is urgently needed.},

More than 1 million hives are transported to California each year just to pollinate the almonds and bees are trucked across the country for various cropping systems. Concerns have been raised about whether such “migratory management” causes bees undue stress; however to date there have been no longer-term studies rigorously addressing whether migratory management is detrimental to bee health. To address this issue, we conducted field experiments comparing bees from commercial and experimental migratory beekeeping operations to those from stationary colonies to quantify effects on lifespan, colony health and productivity and levels of oxidative damage for individual bees. We detected a significant decrease in lifespan of migratory adult bees relative to stationary bees. We also found that migration affected oxidative stress levels in honey bees, but that food scarcity had an even larger impact; some detrimental effects of migration may be alleviated by a greater abundance of forage. In addition, rearing conditions affect levels of oxidative damage incurred as adults. This is the first comprehensive study on impacts of migratory management on the health and oxidative stress of honey bees.},

Beekeeping management practices vary from low to high intervention regarding the use of chemicals, hive manipulations, and supplemental feeding of colonies. In this study, we use quantitative data from the Bee Informed Partnership\&rsquo;s national survey to investigate drivers of management practices among beekeepers in the United States. This is the first study to quantitatively examine these variables to objectively describe the management practices among different groups of beekeepers in the United States. We hypothesized that management practices and goals among beekeepers are different based on the beekeeper\&rsquo;s philosophy (as determined by their willingness to use chemicals to control pests and pathogens) and the size of the beekeeping operation. Using a multiple factor analysis, we determined that beekeepers use a continuum of management practices. However, we found that beekeepers\&rsquo; willingness to use in-hive chemicals and the number of colonies in their operation are non-randomly associated with other aspects of beekeeping management practices. Specifically, the size of the beekeeping operation was associated with beekeepers\&rsquo; choices of in-hive chemicals, while beekeepers\&rsquo; philosophy was most strongly associated with choices of in-hive chemicals and beekeeping goals. Our results will facilitate the development of decision-making tools for beekeepers to choose management practices that are appropriate for the size of their operations and their beekeeping philosophy.},

Little attention has, however, been paid to the systemic response of mutualistic communities to global environmental change.

Specifically, we show that pollinator populations may collapse suddenly once drivers of pollinator decline reach a critical point. A high connectance and/or nestedness of the mutualistic network increases the capacity of pollinator populations to persist under harsh conditions. However, once a tipping point is reached, pollinator populations collapse simultaneously. Recovering from this single community-wide collapse requires a relatively large improvement of conditions.

	abstract = {Mutually beneficial interactions between flowering plants and animal pollinators represent a critical ‘ecosystem service’ under threat of anthropogenic extinction. We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least–linked (most specialized) to most–linked (most generalized), and systematically from most– to least–linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most–linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most–linked pollinators were bumble–bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems.},

	abstract = {En 2008, expertos de Europa y EEUU formaron una red, llamada COLOSS, con el objetivo de explicar y prevenir la pérdida de colonias de abejas a gran escala. Esta acción se designó en Junio del 2008 por la Unión Europea como acción COST FA0803. Se desarrolló un cuestionario estandarizado COLOSS que permitiera la comparación de los datos de pérdida entre los países participantes. Los datos presentados en este estudio fueron recogidos en 2009 en 12 países y en 2010 en 24. Las pérdidas invernales medias de colonias de abejas en Europa mostraron una gran variación del 7 al 22\% en el invierno de 2008-9 y del 7 al 30\% en 2009-10. Una observación importante es que para todos los países participantes en 2009, las pérdidas invernales observadas en 2010 fueron sustancialmente mayores que en 2009. En 2010 las perdidas invernales en el sureste de Europa fueron de un nivel tan bajo que parece que los factores causantes de las pérdidas en otras partes de Europa estuvieron ausentes o no a un nivel que afecta a la supervivencia de la colonia. Las cinco provincias de China, que fueron incluidas en 2010, mostraron una media muy baja (4\%) de pérdidas invernales de Apis mellifera. Seis provincias de Canadá mostraron una variación de 16-25\% de media de pérdidas invernales en 2010 con excepción de Nueva Escocia (40\%). En la mayoría de los países y en ambos años de monitorización, los apicultores hobbistas (con 1-50 colonias) experimentaron mayores pérdidas en comparación con apicultores medianos (51500 colonias). En 2010 se observó también este efecto, pero menos pronunciado. En Bélgica, Italia, Holanda y Polonia las pérdidas invernales medias en 2008-9 de apicultores que informaron de desaparición de colonias fue significativamente mayor en comparación con las pérdidas invernales medias de apicultores que no informaron de desaparición de colonias. Pérdidas invernales medias en 2008-9 en Holanda de apicultores que informaron de síntomas de “CCD” de: 1. ninguna abeja muerta en la colonia mientras; 2. había cría operculada presente fueron mayores que las pérdidas invernales medias de apicultores que informaron sobre desaparición de colonias sin cría operculada presente en colmenas vacías. En el invierno de 2009-10 apicultores que informaron de desaparición de colonias experimentaron mayores pérdidas invernales en comparación con apicultores con pérdidas invernales pero que no informaron de desaparición de colonias en la mayoría de los países.},

	abstract = {The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60\% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35\% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5\% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

	abstract = {Background Over the last two winters, there have been large-scale, unexplained losses of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies in the United States. In the absence of a known cause, this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD. Methods and Principal Findings Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies. Conclusions/Significance This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to quantify the degree and extent of losses experienced in U.S. beekeeping operations between September 2006 and March 2007, members of the Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) were asked to survey beekeepers who represent the hobby, sideline, and commercial beekeeping industries of their state. In all, 384 beekeeping operations were surveyed representing a total of 143,816 colonies plus 9,507 splits made between September and March. The total loss and average loss of bees in all operations was 31.8\% and 37.6\%, respectively. Of the surveyed beekeepers, 51.9\% reported “abnormally heavy losses”; these beekeepers had a total loss of 55.4\%, compared to the 15.9\% total loss experienced by beekeepers who reported “normal losses”. Of responding beekeepers reporting the number of hives containing few or no bees in spring, 23.8\% met the specified definition of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), meaning that 50\% of their dead colonies were found without bees and/or with very few dead bees in the hive or apiary. CCD-suffering operations had a total loss of 45.0\% compared to the total loss of 25.4\% of all colonies experienced by nonCCD suffering beekeepers. Most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the leading cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelming believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the leading cause of colony mortality. Considerable variability in losses and in the proportion of operations suffering from CCD was reported from the various states.},

This paper explores the importance of those additional climatic variables other than temperature and precipitation. Using the county-level agricultural data from 1980 to 2010 in China, we find that those additional climatic variables, especially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those variables is likely to bias the predicted impacts of climate change on crop yields. In particular, omitting humidity tends to overpredict the cost of climate change on crop yields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. Our preferred specification indicates that climate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in China by 36.25\%, 18.26\%, and 45.10\%, respectively, by the end of this century.},

Using farm-level survey data from the Brazilian Amazon, I estimate a production function to assess the value of forest fallow and test whether it provides local externalities to agricultural production. Soil quality controls, instrumental variables, and spatial econometric approaches help address endogeneity issues. I use GIS data on external forest cover at the farm level and model the hydrological externality as an upstream-to-downstream process. The estimated parameters indicate that fallow contributes signiﬁcantly to productivity both on farm and downstream. In addition, most farms allocate sufﬁcient land to fallow, accounting for both the value of hydrological spillovers and the opportunity cost of land left out of cultivation. These results suggest that farming communities may have some self-interest in preserving forest cover locally—a ﬁnding that may bolster policy efforts aimed at conserving tropical forests for their global public goods.},

@article{abadie_risk_nodate,
	title = {The {Risk} of {Machine} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the eﬀects of many-valued treatments (like teacher eﬀects or location eﬀects), treatment eﬀects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-ﬁtting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein’s unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

We show the optimality of such a voting procedure by arguing that it is ﬁrst best, that is, it maximizes welfare when equilibrium constraints are ignored, and by showing that individual incentives and social welfare are sufﬁciently aligned to make a ﬁrst best procedure incentive compatible. We also provide counterexamples where no ﬁrst best procedure is incentive compatible when voters’ binary types are not equally likely.},

	abstract = {Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological cohort studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of causes1,2,3,4,5, including the long-term health impacts of ozone and fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5)3,4,5,6,7,8,9. It has proved difficult to quantify premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various sources may vary10. Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate the link between premature mortality and seven emission source categories in urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for 2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61–4.81) million premature deaths per year worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are equally toxic5, but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.},

Specific detection and isolation of cancer-cell-derived exosomes in the circulation is currently lacking. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we identify a cell surface proteoglycan, glypican-1 (GPC1), specifically enriched on cancer-cell-derived exosomes. GPC1+ circulating exosomes (crExos) were monitored and isolated using flow cytometry from the serum of patients and mice with cancer. GPC1+ crExos were detected in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer with absolute specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing healthy subjects and patients with a benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. Levels of GPC1+ crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1+ crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging. GPC1+ crExos may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and screening tool to detect early stages of pancreatic cancer to facilitate possible curative surgical therapy.},

Whether such correlation implies a high unavoidable intrinsic cancer risk has become a key public health debate with the dissemination of the ‘bad luck’ hypothesis. Here we provide evidence that intrinsic risk factors contribute only modestly (less than {\textasciitilde}10–30\% of lifetime risk) to cancer development. First, we demonstrate that the correlation between stem-cell division and cancer risk does not distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We then show that intrinsic risk is better estimated by the lower bound risk controlling for total stem-cell divisions. Finally, we show that the rates of endogenous mutation accumulation by intrinsic processes are not sufficient to account for the observed cancer risks. Collectively, we conclude that cancer risk is heavily influenced by extrinsic factors. These results are important for strategizing cancer prevention, research and public health.},

Can it be solely attributed to the EU feeling morally obliged to be the main initiator of continued progress on the climate change negotiations, or can industrial interests in the EU, at least partly, explain the behaviour of the EU? We suggest that the individual member countries in the EU, such as Germany and Denmark, have a rational economic interest in forcing the technological development of renewable energy sources to get a first-mover advantage. Here, the Kyoto Protocol, which imposes binding greenhouse gas reductions on 38 OECD countries, implies that, as a first-mover, the EU will potentially sell the necessary new renewable technologies, most prominently wind mills, to other countries. In the latest EU proposal made in Johannesburg, the EU pushed for setting a target of 15\% of all energy to come from sources such as windmills, solar panels and waves by 2015. Such a political target level would further the EU’s interests globally, and could suggest, in economic terms, why the EU eagerly promotes greenhouse gas trade at a global level. In contrast, the US has left the Kyoto agreement to save the import costs of buying the EU’s renewable energy systems.},

	abstract = {In recent years, honeybees (Apis mellifera) have been strangely disappearing from their hives, and strong colonies have suddenly become weak and died. The precise aetiology underlying the disappearance of the bees remains a mystery. However, during the same period, Nosema ceranae, a microsporidium of the Asian bee Apis cerana, seems to have colonized A. mellifera, and it's now frequently detected all over the world in both healthy and weak honeybee colonies. For first time, we show that natural N. ceranae infection can cause the sudden collapse of bee colonies, establishing a direct correlation between N. ceranae infection and the death of honeybee colonies under field conditions. Signs of colony weakness were not evident until the queen could no longer replace the loss of the infected bees. The long asymptomatic incubation period can explain the absence of evident symptoms prior to colony collapse. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that healthy colonies near to an infected one can also become infected, and that N. ceranae infection can be controlled with a specific antibiotic, fumagillin. Moreover, the administration of 120 mg of fumagillin has proven to eliminate the infection, but it cannot avoid reinfection after 6 months. We provide Koch's postulates between N. ceranae infection and a syndrome with a long incubation period involving continuous death of adult bees, non-stop brood rearing by the bees and colony loss in winter or early spring despite the presence of sufficient remaining pollen and honey.},

The debate over SMRs has been particularly intense because of the rapid failure of large “nuclear renaissance” reactors in market economies, the urgent need to address climate change, and the dramatic success of alternative, decentralized resources in lowering costs and increasing deployment. This paper assesses the prospects for SMR technology from three perspectives: the implications of the history of cost escalation in nuclear reactor construction for learning, economies of scale and other process that SMR advocates claim will lower cost; the challenges SMR technology faces in terms of high costs resulting from lost economies of scale, long lead time needed to develop a new design, the size of the task to create assembly lines for modular reactors and intense concern about safety; and the cost and other characteristics – e.g. scalability, speed to market, flexibility, etc. – of available alternatives compared SMR technology. The paper concludes that the decision of the major vendors (Westinghouse and B\&W) to dramatically reduce SMR development efforts reflects the severe disadvantages that SMR technology faces in the next several decades.},

	abstract = {When most Americans think of environmentalism, they think of the political left, of vegans dressed in organic-hemp fabric, lofting protest signs. In reality, writes Jacob Darwin Hamblin, the movement--and its dire predictions--owe more to the Pentagon than the counterculture.

In Arming Mother Nature, Hamblin argues that military planning for World War III essentially created "catastrophic environmentalism": the idea that human activity might cause global natural disasters. This awareness, Hamblin shows, emerged out of dark ambitions, as governments poured funds into environmental science after World War II, searching for ways to harness natural processes--to kill millions of people. Proposals included the use of nuclear weapons to create artificial tsunamis or melt the ice caps to drown coastal cities; setting fire to vast expanses of vegetation; and changing local climates. Oxford botanists advised British generals on how to destroy enemy crops during the war in Malaya; American scientists attempted to alter the weather in Vietnam. This work raised questions that went beyond the goal of weaponizing nature. By the 1980s, the C.I.A. was studying the likely effects of global warming on Soviet harvests. "Perhaps one of the surprises of this book is not how little was known about environmental change, but rather how much," Hamblin writes. Driven initially by strategic imperatives, Cold War scientists learned to think globally and to grasp humanity's power to alter the environment. "We know how we can modify the ionosphere," nuclear physicist Edward Teller proudly stated. "We have already done it."

Teller never repented. But many of the same individuals and institutions that helped the Pentagon later warned of global warming and other potential disasters. Brilliantly argued and deeply researched, Arming Mother Nature changes our understanding of the history of the Cold War and the birth of modern environmental science.},

	abstract = {Stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) at levels expected to prevent dangerous climate changes has become an important, long-term global objective. It is therefore crucial to identify a cost-effective way to achieve this objective. In this paper, we use WITCH, a hybrid climate–energy–economy model, to obtain a quantitative assessment of equilibrium strategies that stabilize CO2 concentrations at 550 or 450ppm. Since technological change is endogenous and multifaceted in WITCH, and the energy sector is modeled in detail, we can provide a description of the ideal combination of technical progress and alternative energy investment paths in achieving the sought stabilization targets. Given that the model accounts for interdependencies and spillovers across 12 regions of the world, equilibrium strategies are the outcome of a dynamic game through which inefficiency costs induced by global strategic interactions can be assessed. Our results emphasize the drastic change in the energy mix that will be necessary to control climate change, the huge investments in existing and new technologies implied, and the crucial role of breakthrough technological innovation.},

As a large socio-technical system, such lock-in effects in an energy system extend beyond the techno-institutional environments to its human dimension. This paper represents an exploratory attempt to bridge the gap between individual and group level analyses of the human side of energy systems. A mix-methods study investigated how French engineering students view nuclear energy and why nuclear energy is perceived the way it is. Sixty-seven students participated in a survey and forty-three of them additionally took part in focus groups. Survey findings showed that participants not only strongly associated nuclear energy with specific imageries; they also exhibited a positive perceptual bias toward nuclear energy. Through focus group discussions, we identified six factors contributing to the observed positive nuclear perception namely historical development, education system, political environment, economy, media coverage and societal influences. These factors constitute sources of lock-in and represent barriers to societal support of energy developments that has relevance beyond France and nuclear energy. Implications of study findings for future research and energy decision-makers engaged in the task of changing a nation's energy system are discussed.},

Nuclear, hydro, wind, bioenergy and solar generating plants were also evaluated. The objectives were to assess the comparative costs of mitigation per tonne of carbon emissions avoided, and to estimate the total amount of carbon mitigation that could result from the global electricity sector by 2010 and 2020 as a result of fuel switching, carbon dioxide sequestration and the greater uptake of renewable energy. Most technologies showed potential to reduce both generating costs and carbon emission avoidance by 2020 with the exception of solar power and carbon dioxide sequestration.

We demonstrate that different means of implementing the Kyoto Agreement affect the potential to market new renewable technologies, e.g. wind turbines, to other countries subsequent to their ratification of the Kyoto target levels. This article shows that a transnationally grandfathered Tradable Permit System (TPS) renders the shadow price of emissions reductions lower in the high-cost reduction countries. Export opportunities to these countries will consequently be reduced under a transnational TPS, e.g. from the EU to the US. This could also serve to explain EU opposition to a fully flexible TPS in The Hague in 2001. Instead, the latest EU proposal delivered in Johannesburg pushed for setting a target of 15\% of all energy to come from sources of renewable energy, e.g. wind turbines, solar panels, biomass and waves, by 2015. Such initiative would further EU industrial interests globally. Future research should, however, attempt to provide more empirical evidence concerning this proposition and its importance compared to other concerns.},

	abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

Despite building the world's largest fleet of reactors and seeding most of the designs built worldwide, US commercial nuclear development has dramatically slowed. Indeed, the nuclear power industry now faces unprecedented challenges. The nation's demand for electricity has decreased, and the power distribution grid is rapidly becoming decentralized. Nuclear power is having trouble competing in current deregulated energy markets dominated by low-cost natural gas and renewable energy sources. The industry hasn't been able to build new power plants within budget and in a timely manner, as recent efforts in South Carolina and Georgia illustrate. There are concerns about safety, waste management, and nuclear proliferation. There is a way forward that could help the nuclear industry, enhance international control regimes for nuclear power and fuels, and aid in addressing climate change.

Proponents of these technologies have used “trade-off” frames to promote these technologies in the face of current and potential opposition to them. This article examines the nature and limits of the trade-off frames being used and their probability of success. We argue that using the language of trade-offs is generally a suboptimal framing strategy: trade-off frames remind the public of the costs associated with particular policies, and therefore play into the hands of policy opponents. However, policy advocates may turn to them when the costs of a technology are well known and are perceived as high. In such cases, trade-off frames may help to justify controversial policy solutions. Like any frames, the trade-off frames used in the debate over climate change solutions both illuminate and obscure the deeper issues involved in energy policy reform.},

So, it is appropriate to devote this lecture to one of the most pressing and profound issues that confront humanity: that of war and peace.

I would like to suggest that we should perhaps change direction in our efforts to bring about world peace. Up to now, all the effort has been put into resolving specific conflicts: India–Pakistan, North–South Ireland, various African wars, Balkan wars, Russia–Chechnya, Israel–Arab, etc., etc. I'd like to suggest that we should shift emphasis and study war in general.

Let me make a comparison. There are two approaches to cancer. One is clinical. You have, say, breast cancer. What should you do? Surgery? Radiation? Chemotherapy? Which chemotherapy? How much radiation? Do you cut out the lymph nodes? The answers are based on clinical tests, simply on what works best. You treat each case on its own, using your best information. And your aim is to cure the disease, or to ameliorate it, in the specific patient before you.

And, there is another approach. You don't do surgery, you don't do radiation, you don't do chemotherapy, you don't look at statistics, you don't look at the patient at all. You just try to understand what happens in a cancerous cell. Does it have anything to do with the DNA? What happens? What is the process like? Don't try to cure it. Just try to understand it. You work with mice, not people. You try to make them sick, not cure them.

War has been with us ever since the dawn of civilization. Nothing has been …

When environmental goods and services become the object of information compaction, it is possible that important information is lost.

Throughout history, institutions have been devised by human beings to create order and reduce uncertainty in exchange. Together with the standard constraints of economics they define the choice set and therefore determine transaction and production costs and hence the profitability and feasibility of engaging in economic activity. They evolve incrementally, connecting the past with the present and the future; history in consequence is largely a story of institutional evolution in which the historical performance of economies can only be understood as a part of a sequential story. Institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy; as that structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth, stagnation, or decline.

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to €153 billion, which represented 9.5\% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between €190 and €310 billion based upon average price elasticities of − 1.5 to − 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about €50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged €151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged €761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories – namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.},

	abstract = {Current national and global scale monetary valuation of pollination services do not accurately estimate the contribution of wild pollinators to agricultural production. First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in practice. Over half of the €153 billion of estimated global pollination service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys the literature on pollinator declines and related concerns regarding global food security. Methods for valuing the economic risks associated with pollinator declines are also reviewed. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach is introduced to assess the effects of a global catastrophic loss of pollinators. There appears to be evidence supporting a trend towards future pollinator shortages in the United States and other regions of the world. Results from the CGE model show economic risks to both direct crop sectors and indirect noncrop sectors in the economy, with some amount of regional heterogeneity.},
