1. At what frequency does the EPA evaluate the Design Values to assign attainment status? What are the common costs associated with being found non-attainment? 



2. Who decides when and where to place new AQS monitors? 




3. At the local/regional level, who is in charge of recording ambient air quality at the AWS monitor? Who can make decisions about when the monitor should be on and recording data? Once data is recorded, is the data automatically sent to the AQS database or is there an opportunity for the local data manager to quality-check the data first and selectively not report some observations?
