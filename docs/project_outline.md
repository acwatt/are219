# Policy analysis
- How do predicted attainment statuses compare to psuedo attainment statuses (and real)
- How does the differenece in attainment status (or design value) change with variables? Can we explain the differences betw in vars that we expect and vars that we are concerned about (demographics)


# Final outputs
- 3-way design value table (real, pseudo, estimated without missing)
- maps of counties
  - heat map based on the size of difference btween the pseudo and estimated design values 
  - categorized map based on aggree or disagree (or 4 colors: aggree on non-attainment, aggree on attainment, pseudo=attain but est=nonattain (RED), pseudo=nonattain but est=attain)
