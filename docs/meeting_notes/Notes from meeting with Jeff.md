predict the missign data with only EPA data, usign intent from local pollution alerts and compare the PA on the same time (maybe predicted missing EPA values from PA)

difference in means between PA data at missing times and PA full distribution
calculate probabilty of a missing time having a PA value higher than the mean of the full PA distribution



If PA truly differs based on underlying pollution dist, we'd expext some monitors/areas to have
consistent differeces.

given PA netowrk, where would I locate the "mean" monitor. how does that compare to the EPA monitor (similar to merediths paper with satellites)


Stick with hypothesis testing:
IF you can prove that it works better in some formal sense, that's fine, but stay away from just a policy prescription.

Find a project that's interesting, practical, then figure out what tool you need and learn it.
